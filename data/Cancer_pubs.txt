AB  - Rectourethral fistula (RUF) and puboprostatic fistula (PPF) are potentially
      devastating complications that can develop after various pelvic insults, most
      notable treatment of prostate cancer. Both entities represent surgical challenges
      given the complex anatomy, risk of injury to adjacent structures, and poor tissue
      quality and wound healing. While extirpative surgery may be necessary for some
      patients, meticulous surgical dissection and interposition of healthy muscle
      allow for fistula repair in a high proportion of appropriately selected patients,
      especially in RUF. Herein the authors describe the nature, management, and
      outcomes of RUF and PPF with a full review of the literature.

AB  - Male stress urinary incontinence most commonly presents secondary to prostate
      treatment of prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia, although it can be 
      seen following trauma or secondary to neurologic dysfunction. Patient selection
      is supremely important when choosing the appropriate nonoperative or surgical
      treatment. Although most patients prefer the passive mechanism of adjustable
      balloon devices or slings, the artificial urinary sphincter provides the most
      efficacious and durable results with regard to patient satisfaction and
      continence. Changes in prostate treatment modalities and anti-incontinence device
      development will offer more surgical options for patients in the future.

AB  - Posterior pelvic fracture urethral distraction defects (PFUDD) can present
      formidable challenges in genitourinary reconstruction. Once the acuity of trauma 
      subsides, the patient is often faced with chronic, debilitating genitourinary
      injuries. Treatment requires an astute diagnostic and technical approach, with
      definitive repair best accomplished in the hands of experts. A delayed, stepwise 
      approach to repair following the resolution of acute injuries remains a
      time-tested platform for optimal outcomes. The evaluation, relevant anatomy, and 
      approach to surgical repair are described herein.

TI  - Estimating the impact of COVID-19 on changes in volume sales of cigars, smokeless
      tobacco products, pipe, and roll-your-own tobacco in the United States.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We examined the potential impact of COVID-19 on trends in volume
      sales of non-cigarette combustible and smokeless tobacco products in the U.S.
      METHODS: We analyzed monthly national sales for cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe, 
      and roll-your-own tobacco during June 2019-June 2021. Data were from the U.S
      Department of the Treasury. Interrupted time series were used to measure
      associations of the COVID-19 "shock" (taken as June 2020 or 6 months after the
      first diagnosis of COVID-19 in the US) and volume sales. Negative binomial
      regression was used to evaluate associations between volume sales and changes in 
      community mobility. RESULTS: Within interrupted time series analysis, the shock
      of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an initial increase in the number of
      little cigars sold by 11.43 million sticks (p<0.01), with no significant
      sustained change in trend. The COVID-19 shock was also associated with an initial
      increase in large cigar volume sales by 59.02 million sticks, followed by a
      subsequent decrease by 32.57 million sticks per month (p=0.005). Every 10%
      reduction in mobility to retail stores was significantly associated with reduced 
      volume sales of little cigars (IRR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.98) and large cigars
      (IRR = 0.92, 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96). Other findings were statistically
      non-significant. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was associated with increased volume sales 
      for cigars and there was a significant association between reduced mobility to
      points of sale and reduced cigar volume sales. Intensified efforts are needed to 
      prioritize evidence-based tobacco prevention and control efforts amidst the
      pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: At the six-month mark following the start of the COVID-19
      pandemic in the US, we found that the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic was
      associated with a statistically significant initial increase in the number of
      little and large cigars sold nationwide.These COVID-19 related trends may have
      momentarily reversed the long-term declines seen in cigar sales prior to the
      pandemic.Intensified implementation of evidence-based tobacco control and
      prevention measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may help reduce aggregate
      tobacco consumption.

AB  - The development of novel therapeutic approaches is necessary to manage
      gastrointestinal cancers (GICs). Considering the effective molecular mechanisms
      involved in tumor growth, the therapeutic response is pivotal in this process.
      Autophagy is a highly conserved catabolic process that acts as a double-edged
      sword in tumorigenesis and tumor inhibition in a context-dependent manner.
      Depending on the stage of malignancy and cellular origin of the tumor, autophagy 
      might result in cancer cell survival or death during the GICs' progression.
      Moreover, autophagy can prevent the progression of GIC in the early stages but
      leads to chemoresistance in advanced stages. Therefore, targeting specific arms
      of autophagy could be a promising strategy in the prevention of chemoresistance
      and treatment of GIC. It has been revealed that autophagy is a cytoplasmic event 
      that is subject to transcriptional and epigenetic regulation inside the nucleus. 
      The effect of epigenetic regulation (including DNA methylation, histone
      modification, and expression of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in cellular fate is
      still not completely understood. Recent findings have indicated that epigenetic
      alterations can modify several genes and modulators, eventually leading to
      inhibition or promotion of autophagy in different cancer stages, and mediating
      chemoresistance or chemosensitivity. The current review focuses on the links
      between autophagy and epigenetics in GICs and discusses: 1) How autophagy and
      epigenetics are linked in GICs, by considering different epigenetic mechanisms;
      2) how epigenetics may be involved in the alteration of cancer-related
      phenotypes, including cell proliferation, invasion, and migration; and 3) how
      epidrugs modulate autophagy in GICs to overcome chemoresistance.

AB  - CONTEXT: End-of-Life (EOL) care consumes a substantial amount of healthcare
      resources, especially among older persons with cancer. Having Alzheimer's Disease
      and Related Dementias (ADRD) brings additional complexities to these patients'
      EOL care. OBJECTIVES: To examine the Medicare expenditures at the EOL (last
      twelve months of life) among beneficiaries having cancer and ADRD versus those
      without ADRD. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study used 2004-2016 Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data. Patient populations were deceased
      Medicare beneficiaries with cancer (breast, lung, colorectal, and prostate) and
      continuously enrolled for 12 months before death. Beneficiaries with ADRD were
      propensity score matched with non-ADRD counterparts. Generalized Estimating
      Equation Model was deployed to estimate monthly Medicare expenditures.
      Generalized Linear Models were constructed to assess total EOL expenditures.
      RESULTS: 86,396 beneficiaries were included (43,198 beneficiaries with ADRD and
      43,198 beneficiaries without ADRD). Beneficiaries with ADRD utilized $64,901 at
      the EOL, which was roughly $407 more than those without ADRD ($64,901 vs.
      $64,494, p=0.31). Compared to beneficiaries without ADRD, those with ADRD had 11%
      higher monthly expenditure and 7% higher in total expenditures. Greater
      expenditure was incurred on inpatient (5%), skilled nursing facility (SNF)
      (119%), home health (42%), and hospice (44%) care. CONCLUSION: Medicare spending 
      at the EOL per beneficiary was not statistically different between cohorts.
      However, specific types of service (i.e., inpatient, SNF, home health, and
      hospice) were significantly higher in the ADRD group compared to their non-ADRD
      counterparts. This study underscored the potential financial burden and informed 
      Medicare about allocation of resources at the EOL.

AB  - CONTEXT: Life Review Intervention (LRI) has starting to shift in emphasis of
      focus onto persons with cancer and its effectiveness in improving their
      psychological well-being. The process has now begin integrating into healthcare
      settings as a complementary treatment for this population. OBJECTIVES: The
      current systematic review aims to synthesize existing feasibility studies on LRI 
      among persons with cancer. METHODS: A literature search was conducted from the
      databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsychArticles, Scopus, Psychology and Behavioral
      Science Collection, Cochrane, and EBSCO, and other methods. Eligible articles
      were selected based on the predetermined inclusion criteria and data extraction
      revolved around the study design, intervention procedure, and feasibility and
      psychological outcome measures. RESULTS: The search yielded 8,627 articles, to
      which respondents simultaneously receiving other forms of psychological
      interventions were excluded. Eight were selected for evaluation. Four were
      integrated interventions while the remaining were conducted with the standard
      intervention. The sample size range between five to 90 persons with cancer. All
      reviewed articles reported optimum feasibility, as presented by recruitment
      capability, participant retention rate, acceptability and satisfaction,
      intervention implementation, and evaluation of intervention outcome measures.
      However, a majority of psychological outcome measures indicated no statistical
      significance. CONCLUSION: LRI is feasible to be implemented among persons with
      cancer, given the high acceptability and availability of resources for its
      implementation. The present review highlighted the preliminary knowledge on the
      feasibility of the intervention.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), considered a mortal recalcitrant cancer, is a
      severe healthcare issue because of its poor prognosis, early metastasis, drug
      resistance and limited clinical treatment options. In our previous study, we
      established a MRP1-targeted antibody-IR700 system (Mab-IR700) for near infrared
      photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT) which exhibited a promising therapeutic effect on
      drug resistant H69AR cells both in vitro and in vivo, though the tumor growth
      suppression effect did not last long with a single round of PIT treatment. To
      achieve a better anticancer effect, we have combined Mab-IR700-mediated NIR-PIT
      with liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil(R)) and investigated the in vitro and in vivo
      cytotoxicity by using a H69AR/3T3 cell co-culture model in which 3T3 cells were
      used to mimic stromal cells. Cytotoxicity experiments demonstrated the
      specificity of Mab-IR700 to H69AR cells, while cytotoxicity and flow cytometry
      experiments confirmed that H69AR cells were doxorubicin-resistant. Compared with 
      Mab-IR700-mediated PIT or Doxil-mediated chemotherapy, the combination therapy
      exhibited the best cell killing effect in vitro and superior tumor growth
      inhibition and survival prolongation effect in vivo. Super enhanced permeability 
      and retention (SUPR) effect was observed in both co-culture spheroids and
      tumor-bearing mice. Owing to an approximately 9-fold greater accumulation of
      Doxil within the tumors, NIR-PIT combined with Doxil resulted in enhanced
      antitumor effects compared to NIR-PIT alone. This photoimmunochemotherapy is a
      practical strategy for the treatment of chemoresistant SCLC and should be further
      investigated for clinical translation.

AB  - The transmembrane protein, CD47, is recognized as an important innate immune
      checkpoint, and CD47-targeted drugs have been in development with the aim of
      inhibiting the interaction between CD47 and the regulatory glycoprotein
      SIRPalpha, for antitumor immunotherapy. Further, CD47 mediates other essential
      functions such as cell proliferation, caspase-independent cell death (CICD),
      angiogenesis and other integrin-activation-dependent cell phenotypic responses
      when bound to thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) or other ligands. Mounting strategies that
      target CD47 have been developed in pre-clinical and clinical trials, including
      antibodies, small molecules, siRNAs, and peptides, and some of them have shown
      great promise in cancer treatment. Herein, the authors endeavor to provide a
      retrospective of ligand-mediated CD47 regulatory mechanisms, their roles in
      controlling antitumor intercellular and intracellular signal transduction, and an
      overview of CD47-targetd drug design.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are among the well-known neoplasms 
      originating in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. Despite advancements in
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, the survival rates of the patients are
      low, which has posed a major therapeutic challenge. A growing number of
      non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), for instance, microRNAs, have been identified whose
      abnormal expression patterns have been implicated in HNSCC. However, more
      recently, several seminal research has shown that piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs),
      a promising and young class of small ncRNA, are linked to the emergence and
      progression of cancer. They can regulate transposable elements (TE) and gene
      expression through multiple mechanisms, making them potentially more powerful
      regulators than miRNAs. Hence, they can be more promising ncRNAs candidates for
      cancer therapeutic intervention. Here, we surveyed the roles and clinical
      implications of piRNAs and their PIWI proteins partners in tumorigenesis and
      associated molecular processes of cancer, with a particular focus on HNSCC, to
      offer a new avenue for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic interventions for
      the malignancy, improving patient's outcomes.

TI  - Effectiveness of mRNA booster vaccine among health Care workers in New York City 
      during the omicron surge, December 2021- January 2022.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe effectiveness of mRNA vaccines by comparing 2-dose (2D)
      and 3-dose (3D) healthcare worker (HCW) recipients in the setting of Omicron
      variant dominance. Performance of 2D and 3D vaccine series against SARS-CoV-2
      variants and the clinical outcomes of HCWs may inform return-to-work guidance.
      METHODS: In a retrospective study from December 15, 2020 - January 15, 2022, SARS
      CoV-2 infections among HCWs at a large tertiary cancer center in New York City
      (NYC) were examined to estimate infection rates over the omicron period
      (aggregated positive tests/person-days) and 95% CIs in 2D and 3D mRNA vaccinated 
      HCWs and were compared using rate ratios. We describe the clinical features of
      post-vaccine infections and impact of prior (pre-Omicron) COVID infection on
      vaccine effectiveness (VE). RESULTS: Among the 20,857 HCWs in our cohort, 20,660 
      completed the 2D series with an mRNA vaccine during our study period and 12,461
      had received a third dose by January 15, 2022. The infection rate ratio for 2D
      vs. 3D vaccinated HCWs was 0.667 (95% CI 0.623, 0.713) for an estimated 3D VE of 
      33.2% compared to 2 doses only during the Omicron dominant period from 12/15/21- 
      1/15/22. Breakthrough (BT) Omicron infections after 3D + 14 days occurred in 1315
      HCWs. Omicron infections were mild, with 16% of 3D and 11% 2D HCWs being
      asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Study demonstrates improved vaccine-derived protection
      against COVID-19 infection in 3D vs. 2D mRNA vaccinees during the Omicron surge. 
      The advantage of 3D vaccination was maintained irrespective of prior COVID-19
      infection status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple studies and meta-analyses have reported the diagnostic value
      of C-reactive protein (CRP) in several diseases. However, the precision, and
      influence of potential bias regarding the diagnostic values of existing evidence 
      may have implications for clinical practice. METHODS: We performed an umbrella
      review of diagnostic test accuracy studies of CRP for diseases by searching
      PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang databases up
      to March 7, 2021. Five independent reviewers evaluated eligibility, extracted
      data, and assessed methodological quality. We descriptively analyzed the
      diagnostic accuracy of CRP for multiple diseases, heterogeneity between studies, 
      and publication bias. RESULTS: Seventy-four meta-analyses were included, with 13 
      diseases classified according to the International Classification of Diseases-11 
      (ICD-11). The methodological quality of the included meta-analyses was mostly
      low, with only 16 meta-analyses rated as moderate or high, including seven
      diseases classified by ICD-11. CRP had a relatively greater diagnostic accuracy
      for two of these diseases. For postoperative infectious complications after
      bariatric surgery, sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 (0.34-1) and 0.91
      (0.73-1), respectively. For anastomotic leakage after colorectal surgery,
      sensitivity and specificity were 0.95 (0.75-0.99) and 0.95 (0.75-0.99),
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of CRP for multiple diseases
      has been extensively studied; however, most studies have low methodological
      quality. Evidence indicates that CRP has a relatively greater diagnostic accuracy
      for inflammation and infection diseases, especially for postoperative infectious 
      complications after bariatric surgery and anastomotic leakage after colorectal
      surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: In vivo optical imaging systems are essential for tracking disease
      progression and evaluating therapeutic efficacy in animal studies. However,
      current approaches are limited by the inability to accurately capture 3D image
      information. To overcome this hindrance, we adopted x-ray computed tomography
      (CT) as a prior for 3D optical image reconstruction and further challenged the
      multimodal imaging performance with a metastasis model. METHODS AND MATERIALS:
      The XXX system, an integrated small animal research platform, features
      co-registered high quality quantitative optical tomography and CT. In the
      synergistic dual-modality imaging, CT provides both 3D anatomy information and
      animal structure mesh for optical tomography reconstruction which is performed
      using bioluminescence projections acquired from 4 orthogonal angles. The
      multimodal imaging system was challenged with a prostate cancer metastasis model 
      and a double-blind histopathology diagnosis was performed to validate the imaging
      results. RESULTS: The XXX located, visualized and quantified early tumor
      metastases at millimeter scale, and can accurately track deep tumors as small as 
      1.5 mm in live animals. Tumors metastasized into the liver, diaphragm, and tibia 
      in four mice were all successfully diagnosed by the integrated tomographic
      imaging. CONCLUSION: Instead of roughly comparing surface light intensities as
      traditionally performed in 2D optical imaging, with integrated CT and optical
      tomography, XXX provides accurate tumor imaging and quantitative assessment
      capabilities for cancer metastasis research. With the powerful 3D optical/CT
      imaging capability, XXX has the potential to tackle more complex research needs
      with higher targeting accuracy.

      Surgery Fellowships.

AB  - The match rate for traditional thoracic surgery fellowships decreased from 97.5% 
      in 2012 to 59.1% in 2021, reflecting an increase in applications. We queried
      whether characteristics of applicants and matriculants to traditional thoracic
      surgery fellowships changed during this time period. Applicant data from the 2008
      through 2018 application cycles were extracted from the Electronic Residency
      Application System (ERAS) and Graduate Medical Education (GME) Track Resident
      Survey and stratified by period of application (2008-2014 vs. 2015-2018).
      Characteristics of applicants and matriculants were analyzed. There were 697
      applicant records in the early period and 530 in the recent period (application
      rate 99.6/year vs 132.5/year; p=0.0005), and 607 matriculant records in the early
      period and 383 in the recent period (matriculation rate 87% vs 72%; p<0.0001).
      There was no difference in representation of University Affiliated versus
      Community Based general surgery residency programs among applicants comparing the
      periods. Higher proportions of applicants and matriculants in the early period
      trained in general surgery programs affiliated with a comprehensive cancer center
      or a thoracic surgery fellowship. Applicants and matriculants of the recent
      period had higher median numbers of journal publications and had higher impact
      factor journal publications. The increase in applicants for thoracic surgery
      training is primarily from general surgery trainees in residency programs not
      affiliated with a comprehensive cancer center or a thoracic surgery fellowship.
      The increased interest in thoracic surgery training was accompanied by overall
      enhanced scholarship production among the applicants and matriculants regardless 
      of their residency characteristics.

      Report.

AB  - Rare cases of IgG-dominant immune complex mediated GN (ICGN) demonstrate
      immunoglobulin (Ig) subclass restriction without light chain restriction. Some of
      these cases may represent proliferative glomerulonephritis with monotypic
      immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID) in which monotypic Ig is obscured by coexisting 
      polytypic Ig. However, rigorous demonstration of this possibility is lacking to
      date. Here, we describe a case of IgG3-restricted ICGN without light chain
      restriction that apparently "transformed" into IgG3kappa-PGNMID in a subsequent
      biopsy. We demonstrate, using several ancillary techniques including the newly
      described antibodies directed against the conformational epitope at the junctions
      of heavy and light chains (HLC-IF), that the first biopsy likely represents
      IgG3kappa-PGNMID in which monotypic IgG3kappa was hidden by polytypic IgM. This
      case underscores the need to consider PGNMID in a differential diagnosis of
      IgG-dominant ICGN without light chain restriction and highlights the potential
      utility of IgG subclass staining and HLC-IF in such cases to detect monotypic Ig 
      that may be obscured by coexisting IgM and/or IgA deposits.

      multifunctional applications.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Organosilica nanoparticles (ONs), which are a new type of
      photoluminescent nanomaterial (PM) with excellent biocompatibility, have caught
      more attention in recent years. However, their applications are significantly
      impeded by the complicated preparation process, poor photostability, and
      especially aggregation-induced quenching. OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed
      to design and prepare solid-state fluorescent ONs to avoid aggregation-induced
      quenching effect. In addition, the uses of ONs for fingerprint detection, white
      light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and lysosome-targetable cellular imaging were
      demonstrated. METHODS: Here, for the first time, we designed and prepared novel
      solid-state fluorescent ultrasmall ONs with orange-emitting photoluminescence via
      a one-step hydrothermal method. RESULTS: The prepared solid-state fluorescent ONs
      could be successfully employed in fingerprint detection, WLEDs fabrication and
      cellular imaging. Intriguingly, the ultrasmall ONs specifically localized to
      lysosomes rather than other subcellular organelles across distinct cell lines,
      including cancer cells and noncancerous cells. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these
      data showed that the new ONs presented in this study could be ideal candidates
      for PMs in biological and photoelectric applications.

TI  - Non-invasive medical gas plasma augments bladder cancer cell toxicity in
      preclinical models and patient-derived tumor tissues.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Medical gas plasma therapy has been successfully applied to several
      types of cancer in preclinical models. First palliative tumor patients suffering 
      from advanced head and neck cancer benefited from this novel therapeutic
      modality. The gas plasma-induced biological effects of reactive oxygen and
      nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) generated in the plasma gas phase result in
      oxidation-induced lethal damage to tumor cells. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to
      verify these anti-tumor effects of gas plasma exposure on urinary bladder cancer.
      METHODS: 2D cell culture models, 3D tumor spheroids, 3D vascularized tumors grown
      on the chicken chorion-allantois-membrane (CAM) in ovo, and patient-derived
      primary cancer tissue gas plasma-treated ex vivo were used. RESULTS: Gas plasma
      treatment led to oxidation, growth retardation, motility inhibition, and cell
      death in 2D and 3D tumor models. A marked decline in tumor growth was also
      observed in the tumors grown in ovo. In addition, results of gas plasma treatment
      on primary urothelial carcinoma tissues ex vivo highlighted the selective
      tumor-toxic effects as non-malignant tissue exposed to gas plasma was less
      affected. Whole-transcriptome gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of
      tumor-promoting fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) accompanied by
      upregulation of apoptosis-inducing factor 2 (AIFm2), which plays a central role
      in caspase-independent cell death signaling. CONCLUSION: Gas plasma treatment
      induced cytotoxicity in patient-derived cancer tissue and slowed tumor growth in 
      an organoid model of urinary bladder carcinoma, along with less severe effects in
      non-malignant tissues. Studies on the potential clinical benefits of this local
      and safe ROS therapy are awaited.

AB  - Explainable artificial intelligence aims to interpret how machine learning models
      make decisions, and many model explainers have been developed in the computer
      vision field. However, the understanding of the applicability of these model
      explainers to biological data is still lacking. In this study, we comprehensively
      evaluated multiple explainers by interpreting pre-trained models of predicting
      tissue types from transcriptomic data and by identifying the top contributing
      genes from each sample with the greatest impacts on model prediction. To improve 
      the reproducibility and interpretability of results generated by model
      explainers, we proposed a series of optimization strategies for each explainer on
      two different model architectures of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and
      convolutional neural network (CNN). We observed three groups of explainer and
      model architecture combinations with high reproducibility. Group II, which
      contains three model explainers on aggregated MLP models, identified top
      contributing genes in different tissues that exhibited tissue-specific
      manifestation and were potential cancer biomarkers. In summary, our work provides
      novel insights and guidance for exploring biological mechanisms using explainable
      machine learning models.

AB  - The recent surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations severely challenges healthcare
      systems around the globe and has increased the demand for reliable tests
      predictive of disease severity and mortality. Using multiplexed targeted mass
      spectrometry assays on a robust triple quadrupole MS setup which is available in 
      many clinical laboratories, we determined the precise concentrations of 100s of
      proteins and metabolites in plasma from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We
      observed a clear distinction between COVID-19 patients and controls and,
      strikingly, a significant difference between survivors and non-survivors. With
      increasing length of hospitalization, the survivors' samples showed a trend
      towards normal concentrations, indicating a potential sensitive readout of
      treatment success. Building a machine learning multi-omic model that considers
      the concentrations of ten proteins and five metabolites we could predict patient 
      survival with 92% accuracy (AUC 0.97) on the day of hospitalization. Hence, our
      standardized assays represent a unique opportunity for the early stratification
      of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Modern medicine continues to evolve, and the treatment armamentarium for various 
      diseases grows more individualized across a breadth of medical disciplines. Cure 
      rates for infectious diseases that were previously pan-fatal approach 100%
      because of the identification of the specific pathogen(s) involved and the use of
      appropriate combinations of drugs, where needed, to completely extinguish
      infection and hence prevent emergence of resistant strains. Similarly, with the
      assistance of technologies such as next-generation sequencing and immunomic
      analysis as part of the contemporary oncology armory, therapies can be tailored
      to each tumor. Importantly, molecular interrogation has revealed that metastatic 
      cancers are distinct from each other and complex. Therefore, it is conceivable
      that rational personalized drug combinations will be needed to eradicate cancers,
      and eradication will be necessary to mitigate clonal evolution and resistance.

TI  - Standardized incidence ratios and risk factors for cancer in patients with
      systemic sclerosis: Data from the Spanish Scleroderma Registry (RESCLE).

AB  - AIM: Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are at increased risk of cancer, a
      growing cause of non-SSc-related death among these patients. We analyzed the
      increased cancer risk among Spanish patients with SSc using standardized
      incidence ratios (SIRs) and identified independent cancer risk factors in this
      population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Spanish Scleroderma Registry data were analyzed
      to determine the demographic characteristics of patients with SSc, and logistic
      regression was used to identify cancer risk factors. SIRs with 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) relative to the general Spanish population were calculated.
      RESULTS: Of 1930 patients with SSc, 206 had cancer, most commonly breast, lung,
      hematological, and colorectal cancers. Patients with SSc had increased risks of
      overall cancer (SIR 1.48, 95% CI 1.36-1.60; P<0.001), and of lung (SIR 2.22, 95% 
      CI 1.77-2.73; P<0.001), breast (SIR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.54; P=0.003), and
      hematological (SIR 2.03, 95% CI 1.52-2.62; P<0.001) cancers. Cancer was
      associated with older age at SSc onset (odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.03;
      P<0.001), the presence of primary biliary cholangitis (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.18-4.68;
      P=0.015) and forced vital capacity <70% (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.24-2.70; P=0.002). The 
      presence of anticentromere antibodies lowered the risk of cancer (OR 0.66, 95% CI
      0.45-0.97; P=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Spanish patients with SSc had an increased
      cancer risk compared with the general population. Some characteristics, including
      specific autoantibodies, may be related to this increased risk.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Xiang-lian pill, consisting of Coptis chinensis
      Franch. coprocessed with Tetradium ruticarpum (A.Juss.) T.G.Hartley
      (Yu-huang-lian) and Aucklandia lappa DC. (Mu-xiang), is traditionally used to
      relieve fever, abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal inflammatory symptoms
      observed in patients with malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract. Each of the
      three herbs contained in Xiang-lian pill has been indicated to have anticancer
      effects on a variety of cancers, but its effects on pancreatic cancer remain
      unexplored. The main extracts of these herbs have anti-pancreatic cancer effects,
      but the comprehensive mechanism of this compound prescription of Xiang-lian pill 
      in pancreatic cancer remains to be revealed. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the
      main active ingredients, potential anti-pancreatic cancer targets, and related
      mechanisms of the Xiang-lian pill and to determine its therapeutic value in vivo.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis were
      applied to screen the potential effective ingredients and key targets.
      Liquid/gas-mass spectrometry was performed for ingredients validation. Molecular 
      docking and the cellular thermal shift assay were performed to test the binding
      efficiency between ingredients and targets. A murine pancreatic cancer model was 
      established and administered different doses of the Xiang-lian pill.
      Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used for histopathological observation.
      Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were conducted for target validation. In 
      vitro studies (cell viability and clonogenicity assays) were conducted to
      investigate the impact of three main ingredients in Xiang-lian pill on pancreatic
      cancer cells. PTGS2 overexpression was performed to reversely confirm the
      antitumor mechanisms of rutaecarpine as a specific PTGS2 inhibitor. RESULTS:
      Results showed that the Xiang-lian pill suppressed pancreatic cancer growth with 
      a 1.56g/kg dose with no significant toxicity. Sixteen potentially active
      ingredients and 26 corresponding therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer were
      identified. PTGS2, PTGS1, KCNH2, PRSS1, and HSP90AA1 were the top 5 significant
      genes targeted by the Xiang-lian pill. Evodiamine, rutaecarpine and stigmasterol 
      bound to PTGS2 and PTGS1 with different affinities and inhibited pancreatic
      cancer cell proliferation. The PTGS2-associated metabolic pathway MEK/ERK was
      downregulated by rutaecarpine in vitro and the Xiang-lian pill in vivo.
      CONCLUSIONS: Xiang-lian pill mainly regulates inflammation, apoptosis,
      metastasis, and metabolism to exert an antitumor effect. The main active
      ingredients in Xiang-lian pill exhibit antitumor roles through directly binding
      to key targets in pancreatic cancer. PTGS2 mediated MEK/ERK inhibition by
      rutaecarpine represents a key therapeutic mechanism of Xiang-lian pill.

AB  - Since the introduction of the cancer stem cell (CSC) paradigm, significant
      advances have been made in understanding the functional and biological plasticity
      of these elusive components in malignancies. Endowed with self-renewing abilities
      and multilineage differentiation potential, CSCs have emerged as cellular drivers
      of virtually all facets of tumor biology, including metastasis, tumor
      recurrence/relapse, and drug resistance. The functional and biological
      characteristics of CSCs, such as self-renewal, cell fate decisions, survival,
      proliferation, and differentiation are regulated by an array of extracellular
      factors, signaling pathways, and pluripotent transcriptional factors. Besides the
      well-characterized regulatory role of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG,
      KLF4, and MYC in CSCs, evidence for the central role of Forkhead box
      transcription factor FOXM1 in the establishment, maintenance, and functions of
      CSCs is accumulating. Conventionally identified as a master regulator of the cell
      cycle, a comprehensive understanding of this molecule has revealed its
      multifarious oncogenic potential and uncovered its role in angiogenesis,
      invasion, migration, self-renewal, and drug resistance. This review compiles the 
      large body of literature that has accumulated in recent years that provides
      evidence for the mechanisms by which FOXM1 expression promotes stemness in
      glioblastoma, breast, colon, ovarian, lung, hepatic, and pancreatic carcinomas.
      We have compiled the data showing the association of stem cell mediators with
      FOXM1 using TCGA mRNA expression data. Further, the prognostic importance of
      FOXM1 and other stem cell markers is presented. The delineation of FOXM1-mediated
      regulation of CSCs can aid in the development of molecularly targeted
      pharmacological approaches directed at the selective eradication of CSCs in
      several human malignancies.

AB  - In this work, novel biocompatible and reduction-responsive soft hydrogels were
      formulated from norbornene (Nb)-functionalized carboxymethyl cellulose (CMCNb).
      To cross-link the CMC-Nb via a highly bioorthogonal inverse electron demand
      Diels-Alder (IEDDA) reaction, we employed a water-soluble and
      reduction-responsive diselenide-based cross-linker possessing two terminal
      tetrazine (Tz) groups with varying molar concentrations (Nb/Tz molar ratios of
      10/10, 10/05, and 10/2.5). The N2 microbubbles liberated as a by-product during
      the IEDDA reaction generated in-situ pores in hydrogel networks. The resulting
      hydrogels had highly porous structures and relatively soft mechanical properties 
      (storage moduli in the range 74 160Pa). The hydrogels showed high swelling ratios
      (>35 times), tunable gelation times (1-5min), and excellent doxorubicin (DOX)
      loading efficiencies (>85%). The hydrogels exhibited stimuli-responsive and fast 
      release of DOX (99%, after 12h) in the presence of 10mmol of glutathione as
      compared to the normal PBS solution (38%). The cytotoxic effects of blank
      hydrogels were not observed against HEK-239 cells, while the DOX-encapsulated
      hydrogels exhibited anti-tumor activity in BT-20 cancer cells. The results
      indicate potential applications of the CMC-based soft hydrogels in injectable
      drug delivery systems.

AB  - Interferon (IFN)-induced protein 35 (IFI35, also known as IFP35), a member of IFN
      induced genes (ISGs), participates in virus infection, cancer progression and the
      chronic inflammatory diseases. However, its roles during fish nodavirus infection
      still remained largely unknown. In the present study, a homolog of IFI35 from
      orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (EcIFI35) was cloned and
      characterized. The open reading frame of EcIFI35 was composed of 1,128 bp, and
      encoded a 375 amino acid polypeptide, which contained two conserved
      N-myc-interactor (Nmi)/IFP35 domains (NIDs). Homology analysis indicated that
      EcIFI35 shared 95.73% and 31.96% identity with homologs of giant grouper (E.
      lanceolatus) and human (Homo sapiens), respectively. The transcription of EcIFI35
      was significantly up-regulated in grouper spleen (GS) cells after challenged with
      red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), polyinosinic:polycytidylic
      acid [poly(I:C)] or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The subcellular localization
      analysis showed that EcIFI35 encoded a cytoplasmic protein. The ectopic
      expression of EcIFI35 inhibited RGNNV replication by reducing viral genes
      transcription and protein synthesis. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay
      demonstrated that EcIFI35 interacted with RGNNV coat protein (CP), and partly
      co-localized with CP. EcIFI35 overexpression promoted the expression of
      IFN-related molecules and pro-inflammatory factors, including IFN regulatory
      factor 7 (IRF7), mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and myxovirus
      resistance gene I (MxI), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), interleukin 6 (IL-6) 
      and IL-8. Together, our results revealed that EcIFI35 interacted with CP and
      inhibited fish nodavirus replication through positively regulated host innate
      immune response.

AB  - Sertoli cells play critical roles in regulating spermatogenesis and testis
      development by providing structural and nutritional support. This study aimed to 
      develop a standard protocol for canine Sertoli cell isolation and culture; and
      characterize its biological features, functionality, and application of compound 
      toxicity testing. Canine testicles were received from the neuter clinic, and
      three-step of enzymatic digestion was applied to isolate Sertoli cells. We
      characterized the growth and purity of Sertoli cells with the expression of SOX9,
      GATA4, and Clusterin. In addition, we selected cadmium as a model toxicant to
      evaluate the toxic responses in the newly established Sertoli cells using
      High-content Analysis (HCA). With our optimized protocol, the purity of isolated 
      Sertoli cells was above 95%, as determined with Sertoli cell-specific protein
      markers of SOX9 and GATA4. More importantly, primary Sertoli cell populations
      could be expanded rapidly in vitro, passaged (up to seven), and cryopreserved.
      The HCA-based assay revealed that cadmium at 1muM induced both disruptions of
      cytoskeletal and DNA damage responses. Furthermore, we established an HCA assay
      with the newly isolated and optimized culture of canine Sertoli cells to evaluate
      the epigenetic markers of histone modification. We found cadmium-induced
      differential changes in histone modifications H3Me3K9, H3Me3K36, H4Me3K20, and
      H4acK5. In summary, we have established the standardized protocol to produce
      canine Sertoli cells with Sertoli cell-specific phenotype. The isolation and
      expansion of large quantities of canine Sertoli cells will provide broad
      applications in studying male infertility, reproductive toxicology, testicular
      cancer, and cell therapy.

LID - 10.1016/j.actbio.2022.07.057 [doi]
AB  - Close to half of human cancers harbor point mutations in the tumor-suppressor p53
      gene, giving rise to the cellular accumulation of mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins
      with novel neomorphic gain-of-function (GOF) properties. The destruction of
      mutp53 proteins through either autophagic or proteasomal degradation is a viable 
      strategy for the targeted therapy of p53-mutated cancers. Several nanomaterials, 
      including zinc-iron and ZIF-8 nanoparticles (NPs), have been reported to induce
      the proteasomal degradation of mutp53 proteins. However, how autophagy, the other
      major cellular degradative pathway, influences NP-induced mutp53 degradation has 
      not been investigated. This article shows that AIE-Mit-TPP, a
      mitochondria-targeting material with aggregation-induced emission (AIE)
      characteristics, elicits ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal degradation of a
      broad range of mutp53 proteins. Meanwhile, AIE-Mit-TPP also induces massive
      mitochondrial damage and autophagy. The inhibition of autophagy further increases
      AIE-Mit-TPP-elicited mutp53 degradation, revealing the negative impact of
      autophagy on AIE-Mit-TPP-induced mutp53 degradation. As expected, the degradation
      of mutp53 proteins by AIE-Mit-TPP abrogated mutp53-manifested GOF, leading to
      reductions in cell proliferation and migration and increases in cell cycle arrest
      and cell death. Consequently, AIE-Mit-TPP inhibited the growth of mutp53 tumors. 
      This paper unravels the interesting interplay between the proteasomal and
      autophagic degradative pathways and pinpoints the modulation of autophagy as a
      potential strategy for optimizing NP-induced mutp53 degradation and p53-targeted 
      cancer therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: We have designed three different types
      of AIE materials: non-targeting (AIE-Br), mitochondria-targeting (AIE-Mit-TPP),
      lysosome-targeting (AIE-Lyso). Our results proved that mitochondria-targeting AIE
      material induced degradation of mutp53 proteins via the proteasome degradation
      pathway and abrogated mutp53-conferred GOF phenotypes. Furthermore, we performed 
      in vitro studies on the effect of the tested materials in mutp53-expressing
      cancer cells and demonstrated our findings via in vivo investigations in a mouse 
      subcutaneous p53(R175H) TOV112D ovarian cancer model. Our results confirmed the
      link between the proteasome pathway and autophagy and thus proposed a strategy of
      combining AIE-Mit-TPP with autophagy inhibitors for the targeted treatment of
      mutp53-associated tumors. Finally, we found that AIE-Mit-TPP could induce
      degradation of a wide-spectrum mutp53 proteins, which makes
      mitochondria-targeting AIE materials an effective therapeutic strategy for
      p53-mutated cancers.

AB  - Vitamin C (VC), in regard to its effectiveness against tumors, has had a
      controversial history in cancer treatment. However, the anticancer mechanisms of 
      VC are not fully understood. Here, we reported that VC exerted an anticancer
      effect on cancer cell and xenograft models via inhibiting HIF-1alpha-dependent
      cell proliferation and promoting p53-dependent cell apoptosis. To be specific, VC
      modulated the competitive binding of HIF-1alpha and p53 to their common E3
      ubiquitin ligase CBL, thereby inhibiting tumorigenesis. Moreover, VC treatment
      activated SIRT1, resulting in p53 deacetylation and CBL-p53 complex dissociation,
      which in turn facilitated CBL recruitment of HIF-1alpha for ubiquitination in a
      proteasome-dependent manner. Altogether, our results provided a mechanistic
      rationale for exploring the therapeutic use of VC in cancer therapy.

AB  - With the help of the establishment of novel reaction methodology, a series of
      N-Aryl-5-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-1,5- dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one conjugates were
      designed and synthesized in 2-4 steps, and subsequent anticancer activity of
      these compounds was evaluated. Preliminary results showed that these compounds
      have moderate to potent activities against human acute leukemia cells K562, human
      lung cancer A549, human breast cancer MDA-MB-231, and human cervical cancer HeLa 
      cancer cell lines. Among them, compounds 2d and 2k were the most potent against
      K562 cell line with IC50 values of 0.07 and 0.52 microM, respectively, and the
      toxicity of 2d to the normal of hepatocytes (LO2) cell line was low (the survival
      rate 81%). Flow cytometry analysis showed that 2d arrested K562 cells in the G2/M
      phase potently, even much better than Combretastatin A4 (CA4). In addition, the
      results demonstrated the involvement of the caspase-dependent or independent
      pathways of apoptosis, evidenced by the upregulation of FADD, pro-caspase 3,
      cleaved-caspase 3, HTRA2/Omi, SMAC/Diablo and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2.The
      biological effects founding of 2d in this work point to prospective uses against 
      acute leukemia.

      national cohort.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of pain medications after radical prostatectomy
      using a large national database. METHODS: The Premier Hospital Database was
      queried to identify all robotic and laparoscopic radical prostatectomies from
      January 2015 - March 2020 with length of stay >/=1 day. "Opioid-sparing" was
      defined as absence of intravenous opioid use after post-operative day 0 and
      absence of oral opioid use throughout admission. Comparisons were made between
      opioid-sparing and non-opioid-sparing prostatectomy. Logistic multivariable
      regression was used to identify predictors of opioid-sparing prostatectomy.
      RESULTS: A total of 62,660 patients were included, of whom 14,806 (23.6%)
      underwent opioid-sparing prostatectomy. Opioid-sparing prostatectomy was
      associated with older age (65 vs. 63 years, p<0.01), white vs. black race (76.3% 
      vs. 73.4%, p<0.01), high-volume surgeons (75.2% vs. 70.0%, p<0.01), and use of
      intravenous ketorolac (62.2% vs. 48.0%, p<0.01), intravenous acetaminophen (32.5%
      vs. 30.1%, p<0.01), and liposomal bupivacaine (5.4% vs. 4.9%, p<0.01). On
      multivariable regression, ketorolac was the strongest predictor of opioid-sparing
      prostatectomy (odds ratio: 1.86, 95% confidence interval: 1.79 - 1.93, p<0.01),
      and black race was predictive of non-opioid sparing prostatectomy (odds ratio:
      0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.71 - 0.80, P<0.01). Ketorolac was not associated
      with increased risk of postoperative bleeding (0.3% vs. 0.3%, p=1.0) or dialysis 
      requirement (<0.1% vs. <0.1%, p=0.91). CONCLUSION: Opioid-sparing radical
      prostatectomy was feasible and associated with administration of each of the
      non-opioid pain medications assessed. Ketorolac was the strongest predictor of
      opioid-sparing prostatectomy and was not associated with increased risk of
      bleeding or dialysis.

AB  - Self-assembled nucleic acid nanostructures have been widely explored for gene
      therapy applications due to their unique advantages. Their roles are not limited 
      to offer intracellular delivery platforms but additionally provide a biological
      function to induce targeted gene regulation. Here, we report a self-assembled
      artificial primary-miRNA (pri-miRNA) for achieving simultaneous multimodal gene
      regulation. Artificial pri-miRNAs are designed to play a role as substrate RNAs
      to recruit and interact with Drosha/DGCR8 (Microprocessor). Incorporation of
      functional RNA motifs and site-specific chemical modification of the primary
      miRNA are utilized for the biogenesis of two individual gene-regulating
      oligonucleotides. Once they are cleaved by the endogenous Drosha/DGCR8 complex,
      basal strands and pre-miRNA can be generated inside of cells. In this study, we
      integrated basal strands with either SMN2 ASO or anti-miR21 to induce multimodal 
      gene regulation. Microprocessing and subsequent gene regulation were first
      evaluated by measuring the activity of reporter pre-miRNA. Chemical modification 
      on the primary miRNA was optimized through a series of in vitro Drosha cleavage
      tests and targeted gene silencing in cells. Primary miRNA with the basal ASO or
      anti-miR strands showed a successful in vitro activity and resulted in
      simultaneous multimodal gene regulation in cells. Artificial primary miRNA may
      offer synergistic therapeutic effects for treating various diseases, including
      spinal muscular atrophy and cancer.

AB  - The microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is essential for the secretion
      of apoB48- and apoB100-containing lipoproteins in the intestine and liver,
      respectively. Loss of function mutations in MTP cause abetalipoproteinemia.
      Heterologous cell expression systems are used to evaluate the function of MTP in 
      apoB secretion to avoid background MTP activity in liver and intestine derived
      cells. However, these systems are not suitable to study the role of MTP in the
      secretion of apoB100-containing lipoproteins, as expression of a large apoB100
      peptide using plasmids is difficult. Here, we report a new cell culture model
      amenable for studying the role of different MTP mutations on apoB100 secretion.
      The cell culture system was developed by ablating the endogenous MTTP gene in
      human hepatoma Huh-7 cells using sgRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein
      complexes. We successfully established three different clones that did not
      express any detectable MTTP mRNA, or MTP protein or activity. These cells were
      defective in secreting apoB-containing lipoproteins, and accumulated lipids.
      Furthermore, we show that transfection of these cells with plasmids expressing
      human MTTP cDNA resulted in the expression of MTP protein, restoration of
      triglyceride transfer activity, and secretion of apoB100. Thus, these new cells
      can be valuable tools for studying structure-function of MTP, roles of different 
      missense mutations in various lipid transfer activities of MTP and their ability 
      to support apoB100 secretion, compensatory changes associated with loss of MTP,
      and in the identification of novel proteins that may require MTP for their
      synthesis and secretion.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most malignant human cancers, with a
      high mortality rate worldwide. Within an HCC tumor, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are 
      responsible for tumor maintenance and progression and may contribute to
      resistance to standard HCC treatments. Previously, we characterized CD133(+)
      cells as CSCs in primary HCC and identified chromenopyrimidinone (CPO) as a novel
      therapeutic for the effective treatment of CD133(+) HCC. However, the biological 
      function and molecular mechanism of CD133 remain unclear. Epigenetic alterations 
      of CSCs have impacts on tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic response. 
      Here, we found that pharmacological and genetic depletion of CD133 in HCC
      attenuated the activity of DNA methyltransferases via control of DNMT3B
      stabilization. Genes were ranked by degree of promoter hypo/hyper methylation and
      significantly differential expression to create an "epigenetically activated by
      CPO" ranked genes list. Through this epigenetic analysis, we found that CPO
      treatment altered DNA methylation-mediated oncogenic signaling in HCCs.
      Specifically, CPO treatment inhibited Adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1
      (CAP1) expression, thereby reducing FAK/ERK activity and EMT-related proteins in 
      HCC. Moreover, CPO improved the efficacy of sorafenib by inhibiting CAP1
      expression and FAK/ERK activation in sorafenib-resistant HCC. These novel
      mechanistic insights may ultimately open up avenues for strategies targeting DNA 
      methylation in liver cancer stem cells and provides novel therapeutic function of
      CPO for the effective treatment of sorafenib-resistant HCC.

AB  - AIMS: Colon cancer (CC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide and is one of the
      most easily altered cancers by dietary regulation. Petunidin
      3-O-[rhamnopyranosyl-(trans-p-coumaroyl)]-5-O-(beta-D-glucopyranoside) (Pt3R5G)
      isolated and purified from Lycium ruthenicum Murray, which exhibits highly
      efficient antioxidant activity and specific anticancer effects, is the flavonoids
      compound. We aimed to study the effect of Pt3R5G on CC cells and elucidate the
      potential underlying mechanisms. MAIN METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by
      the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and
      colony formation assays. Cell cycle, cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species
      (ROS) analysis were performed by flow cytometry. RNA-sequencing was performed to 
      elucidate the potential underlying mechanisms. The lipid peroxidation level of
      cells was detected by malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. The mitochondrial morphology
      of cells was inspected using a transmission electron microscope. Additionally, we
      overexpressed SLC7A11 to perform rescue experiments. In vivo, xenograft mice
      assay was performed to verify the effect of Pt3R5G on the growth of colon cancer.
      KEY FINDINGS: Pt3R5G reduced the cell activity by blocking the cell cycle in
      G0/G1 phase, inducing the apoptosis and ferroptosis in RKO cells. The
      overexpressed of SLC7A11, a significantly down-regulated expression gene caused
      by Pt3R5G, rescued the cell proliferation inhibition and ferroptosis process.
      Furthermore, Pt3R5G inhibited tumor growth in nude mice. Our study suggests that 
      Pt3R5G inhibits RKO cell proliferation through mainly reducing ferroptosis by
      down-regulated SLC7A11. SIGNIFICANCE: As a potential therapeutic drug, Pt3R5G
      showed efficient anticancer activity through a variety of pathways.

AB  - This study deals with the synthesis of hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (HAPnps)
      mediated by Acacia falcata leaf extract. Aggregates of needle-shaped crystalline 
      nanostructures were confirmed by FE-SEM and TEM analysis. Well-defined rings in
      the SAED patterns corroborated the polycrystalline nature of the HAPnps.
      Individual elements present in the HAPnps were attested by the specific signals
      for Ca, P, and O in the EDS and XPS analyses. The distinct peaks observed in the 
      XRD spectrum matched well with the HAP hexagonal patterns with a mean crystallite
      size of 55.04nm. The FTIR study unveiled the coating of the nanoparticles with
      the biomolecules from Acacia falcata leaves. The suspension HAPnps exhibited
      polydispersity (0.446) and remarkable stability (zeta potential: - 31.9mV) as
      evident from DLS studies. The pore diameter was 25.7nm as obtained from BET
      analysis, suggesting their mesoporous nature. The HAPnps showed the cytotoxic
      effect on A549 lung and MDA-MB231 breast carcinoma cell lines, with an IC50 value
      of 55mug/mL. The distortion of the cell membrane and cell morphology, along with 
      the chromatin condensation and cell necrosis on treatment with HAPnps were
      detected under fluorescence microscopy post acridine orange/ethidium bromide dye 
      staining. This study reports the anti-cancerous potential of non-drug-loaded
      plant-mediated HAPnps. Therefore, the HAPnps obtained in this investigation could
      play a vital role in the biomedical field of cancer therapy.

      soils ranged from 20 to 1700ng/g dry weight (DW), with a geometric mean of
      120ng/g DW. These values are significantly higher than other locations, but
      similar or lower to locations nearby well-known PCB contamination sites. No PCB
      spatial distribution pattern was observed. PCB concentrations increase with total
      organic carbon in the soils and proximity to Indiana Harbor and Ship Canal
      (IHSC), where sediments are contaminated with PCBs. Most samples are similar in
      their PCB distribution and Aroclor 1254 yielded the highest similarity to all the
      samples. A fifth of the samples highly resemble other PCB profiles such as EPA
      background and Cedar Rapids Iowa soils, and volatilization from Lake Michigan,
      whereas volatilization from IHSC could not explain the PCBs found in soils. IHSC 
      was expected to be the main source of PCBs in the nearby soils. It is possible
      that soils are impacted by variety of known and unknown sources, including
      volatilization from Lake Michigan, resulting in a regional PCB signal. Although
      PCB concentrations are higher than other locations, samples were below the
      current US EPA non-cancer residential soil level remediation goal for dioxin TEQ.

TI  - Timing of Colonoscopy in Acute Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding: A Multicenter
      Retrospective Cohort Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to determine the optimal timing of colonoscopy and 
      factors that benefit patients who undergo early colonoscopy for acute lower
      gastrointestinal bleeding. METHODS: We identified 10,342 patients with acute
      hematochezia (CODE BLUE-J study) admitted to 49 hospitals in Japan. Of these,
      6,270 patients who underwent a colonoscopy within 120 h were included in this
      study. Inverse probability of treatment weighting method was used to adjust for
      baseline characteristics among early (</=24 h; n=4,133), elective (24-48 h;
      n=1,137), and late (48-120 h; n=1,000) colonoscopy. The average treatment effect 
      was evaluated for outcomes. The primary outcome was 30-day rebleeding. RESULTS:
      The early group had a significantly higher rate of stigmata of recent hemorrhage 
      (SRH) identification and a shorter length of stay (LOS) than the elective and
      late groups. However, the 30-day rebleeding rate was significantly higher in the 
      early group than in the elective and late groups. Interventional radiology
      (IVR)/surgery requirement and 30-day mortality did not significantly differ among
      the groups. The interaction with heterogeneity of effects was observed between
      early/late colonoscopy and shock index (shock index <1: OR, 2.097; shock index
      >/=1: OR, 1.095; P for interaction=0.038) and performance status (PS) (PS 0-2:
      OR, 2.481; PS >/=3: OR, 0.458; P for interaction=0.022) for 30-day rebleeding.
      Early colonoscopy had a significantly lower IVR/surgery requirement in the shock 
      index >/=1 cohort (OR, 0.267; 95% CI, 0.099-0.721) compared with late
      colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Early colonoscopy increased the rate of SRH
      identification and shortened LOS, but involved an increased risk of rebleeding
      and did not improve mortality and IVR/surgery requirement. Early colonoscopy
      benefited particularly patients with shock index >/=1 or performance status >/=3 
      at presentation.

TI  - Less is more: Clinical utility of postoperative labs following minimally invasive
      hysterectomy for endometrial cancer.

LID - 10.1016/j.ajog.2022.07.056 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing rates of same day discharge following minimally
      invasive surgery for endometrial cancer, the need for and value of routine
      postoperative testing is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether routine
      postoperative labs following minimally invasive hysterectomy for endometrial
      cancer leads to clinically significant changes in postoperative care. STUDY
      DESIGN: This is a single-institution retrospective cohort study of patients
      undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy for endometrial cancer by a
      gynecologic oncologist between June 2014-2017. Patient demographics, preoperative
      comorbidities, operative and postoperative data, and pathologic findings were
      manually extracted from the patients' medical records. The financial burden of
      laboratory testing was computed using hospital-level cost data. RESULTS: Of the
      649 women included in the analysis, the majority (91.4%) were white, with a mean 
      age of 61 years, and mean body mass index of 38.0 kg/m2. The most common
      comorbidities were diabetes (31.9%, n=207), chronic pulmonary disease (7.9%,
      n=51), and congestive heart failure (3.2%, n=21). Median operative time was 151
      minutes (range 61-278 minutes) and median estimated blood loss was 100 mL (range 
      10-1500 mL). Most patients (68.6%, n=445) underwent lymphadenectomy. All patients
      had post-operative labs ordered: 100% complete blood count, 99.7% chemistry,
      62.9% magnesium, 46.8% phosphate, 37.4% calcium, and 1.2% liver function tests.
      Twenty-six patients (4.0%) had a change in management due to postoperative lab
      results. Of these 26 women, 88% experienced a change in clinical status that
      would have otherwise prompted testing. Only three (0.5% of entire cohort) were
      asymptomatic: one received a blood transfusion for asymptomatic anemia and the
      other two, who did not carry a diagnosis of diabetes, had interventions for
      hyperglycemia. On univariable analysis, peripheral and cerebrovascular disease,
      diabetes with end organ damage, and a Charlson Comorbidity Index of >/= 3 were
      associated with increased odds of change in management; these were not
      significant on multivariable analysis. Routine postoperative laboratory
      evaluation in this cohort increased hospital costs by $292,000. CONCLUSIONS:
      Routine postoperative labs are unlikely to lead to significant changes in
      management for women undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy for endometrial
      cancer and may increase cost without providing a discernable clinical benefit. In
      the setting of strict post-operative guidelines, laboratory tests should be
      ordered when clinically indicated rather than as part of routine postoperative
      management for women undergoing minimally invasive hysterectomy for endometrial
      cancer.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is one of the most well-characterized growth
      factors and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and differentiation. Its
      receptor EGFR has been extensively explored as a therapeutic target against
      multiple types of cancers, such as lung cancer and glioblastoma. Recent studies
      have established a connection between deregulated EGF signaling and metabolic
      reprogramming, especially rewiring in aerobic glycolysis, which is also known as 
      the Warburg effect and recognized as a hallmark in cancer. Pyruvate kinase M2
      (PKM2) is a rate-limiting enzyme controlling the final step of glycolysis and
      serves as a major regulator of the Warburg effect. We previously showed that PKM2
      T405/S406 O-GlcNAcylation, a critical mark important for PKM2 de-tetramerization 
      and activity, was markedly upregulated by EGF. However, the mechanism by which
      EGF regulates PKM2 O-GlcNAcylation still remains uncharacterized. Here, we
      demonstrated that EGF promoted O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) binding to PKM2 by
      stimulating OGT Y976 phosphorylation. As a consequence, we found PKM2
      O-GlcNAcylation and de-tetramerization were upregulated, leading to a significant
      decrease in PKM2 activity. Moreover, distinct from PKM2, we observed that the
      association of additional phosphotyrosine binding proteins with OGT was also
      enhanced when Y976 was phosphorylated. These proteins included STAT1, STAT3,
      STAT5, PKCdelta, and p85, which are reported to be O-GlcNAcylated. Together, we
      show EGF-dependent Y976 phosphorylation is critical for OGT-PKM2 interaction and 
      propose that this post-translational modification might be important for
      substrate selection by OGT.

AB  - Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) cause a subset of cases of head and neck squamous
      cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Previously, we demonstrated that HPV16 oncogene E6 or
      E6/E7 transduction increases the abundance of O-linked GlcNAcylation (O-GlcNAc)
      transferase (OGT), but the OGT substrates and cellular pathways affected by this 
      increase are unclear. Here, we focus on the effects of O-GlcNAcylation on
      HPV-positive HNSCCs. We found that upon HPV infection, ULK1, an
      autophagy-initiating kinase, is hyper-O-GlcNAcylated, stabilized, and linked with
      autophagy elevation. Through mass spectrometry, we identified that ULK1 is
      O-GlcNAcylated at Ser409, which is distinct from the previously reported
      Thr635/Thr754 sites. It has been demonstrated that PKCalphamediates
      phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser423, which attenuates its stability by shunting
      ULK1 to the chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) pathway. Using biochemical assays,
      we demonstrate that ULK1 Ser409Ser410 O-GlcNAcylation antagonizes its
      phosphorylation at Ser423. Moreover, we found that mutations of Ser409A and its
      neighboring site Ser410A (2A) render ULK1 less stable by promoting interaction
      with the CMA chaperone Hsc70. Further, we determined that ULK1-2A mutants
      attenuate the association of ULK1 with STX17, which is vital for the fusion
      between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
      database reveals that ULK1 is upregulated in HPV-positive HNSCCs and its level
      positively correlates with HNSCC patient survival. Overall, our work demonstrates
      that O-GlcNAcylation of ULK1 is altered in response to environmental changes.
      O-GlcNAcylation of ULK1 at Ser409 and perhaps at its neighboring Ser410
      stabilizes ULK1, and this might underlie the molecular mechanism of HPV-positive 
      HNSCC patient survival.

AB  - Natural products constitute and significantly impact many current anti-cancer
      medical interventions. A subset of natural products induces injury processes in
      malignant cells that recruit and activate host immune cells to produce an
      adaptive anti-cancer immune response, a process known as immunogenic cell death. 
      However, a challenge in the field is to delineate forms of cell death and injury 
      that best promote durable antitumor immunity. Addressing this with a single-cell 
      chemical biology natural product discovery platform, like multiplex activity
      metabolomics, would be especially valuable in human leukemia, where cancer cells 
      are heterogeneous and may react differently to the same compounds. Herein, a new 
      ten-color, fluorescent cell barcoding-compatible module measuring six immunogenic
      cell injury signaling readouts: DNA damage response (gammaH2AX), apoptosis
      (cCAS3), necroptosis (p-MLKL), mitosis (p-Histone H3), autophagy (LC3), and the
      unfolded protein response (p-EIF2alpha). A proof-of-concept screen was performed 
      to validate functional changes in single cells induced by secondary metabolites
      with known mechanisms within bacterial extracts. This assay was then applied in
      multiplexed activity metabolomics to reveal an unexpected mammalian cell injury
      profile induced by the natural product narbomycin. Finally, the functional
      consequences of injury pathways on immunogenicity were compared with three
      canonical assays for immunogenic hallmarks, ATP, HMGB1, and calreticulin, to
      correlate secondary metabolite-induced cell injury profiles with canonical
      markers of immunogenic cell death. In total, this work demonstrated a new
      phenotypic screen for discovery of natural products that modulate injury response
      pathways that can contribute to cancer immunogenicity.

AB  - Mitochondrial chelatable iron contributes to the severity of several injury
      processes, including ischemia/reperfusion, oxidative stress, and drug toxicity.
      However, methods to measure this species in living cells are lacking. To measure 
      mitochondrial chelatable iron in living cells, here we synthesized a new
      fluorescent indicator, mitoferrofluor (MFF). We designed cationic MFF to
      accumulate electrophoretically in polarized mitochondria, where a reactive group 
      then forms covalent adducts with mitochondrial proteins to retain MFF even after 
      subsequent depolarization. We also show in cell-free medium that Fe(2+) (and
      Cu(2+)), but not Fe(3+), Ca(2+), or other biologically relevant divalent cations,
      strongly quenched MFF fluorescence. Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrate in 
      hepatocytes that red MFF fluorescence co-localized with the green fluorescence of
      the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) indicator, rhodamine 123
      (Rh123), indicating selective accumulation into mitochondria. Unlike Rh123,
      mitochondria retained MFF after DeltaPsim collapse. Furthermore, intracellular
      delivery of iron with membrane-permeant Fe(3+)/8-hydroxyquinoline (FeHQ) quenched
      MFF fluorescence by approximately 80% in hepatocytes and other cell lines, which 
      was substantially restored by the membrane-permeant transition metal chelator
      pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone. We also show FeHQ quenched the fluorescence of
      cytosolically co-loaded calcein, another Fe(2+) indicator, confirming that Fe(3+)
      in FeHQ undergoes intracellular reduction to Fe(2+). Finally, MFF fluorescence
      did not change after addition of the calcium mobilizer thapsigargin, which shows 
      MFF is insensitive to physiologically relevant increases of mitochondrial Ca(2+).
      In conclusion, the new sensor reagent MFF fluorescence is an indicator of
      mitochondrial chelatable Fe(2+) in normal hepatocytes with polarized mitochondria
      as well as in cells undergoing loss of DeltaPsim.

AB  - As a platform to deliver imaging and therapeutic agents to targeted sites in
      vivo, nanoparticles (NPs) have widespread applications in diagnosis and treatment
      of cancer. However, the poor in vivo delivery efficiency of nanoparticles limits 
      its potential for further application. Once enter the physiological environment, 
      nanoparticles immediately interact with proteins and form protein corona, which
      changes the physicochemical properties of nanoparticle surface and further
      affects their transport. In this study, we performed molecular dynamics
      simulations to study the adsorption mechanism of nanoparticles with various
      surface modifications and different proteins (e.g., human serum albumin,
      complement protein C3b), and their interactions with cell membrane. The results
      show that protein human serum albumin prefers to interact with hydrophobic and
      positively charged nanoparticles, while the protein C3b prefers the hydrophobic
      and charged nanoparticles. The pre-adsorption of human serum albumin on the
      nanoparticle surface obviously decreases the interaction of nanoparticle with
      C3b. Furthermore, the high amount of protein pre-adsorption could decrease the
      probability of nanoparticle-membrane interaction. These results indicate that
      appropriate modification of nanoparticles with protein provides nanoparticles

TI  - Health service planning to assess the expected impact of centralising specialist 
      cancer services on travel times, equity, and outcomes: a national
      population-based modelling study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Centralisation of specialist cancer services is occurring in many
      countries, often without evaluating the potential impact before implementation.
      We developed a health service planning model that can estimate the expected
      impacts of different centralisation scenarios on travel time, equity in access to
      services, patient outcomes, and hospital workload, using rectal cancer surgery as
      an example. METHODS: For this population-based modelling study, we used routinely
      collected individual patient-level data from the National Cancer Registration and
      Analysis Service (NCRAS) and linked to the NHS Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) 
      database for 11 888 patients who had been diagnosed with rectal cancer between
      April 1, 2016, and Dec 31, 2018, and who subsequently underwent a major rectal
      cancer resection in 163 National Health Service (NHS) hospitals providing rectal 
      cancer surgery in England. Five centralisation scenarios were considered: closure
      of lower-volume centres (scenario A); closure of non-comprehensive cancer centres
      (scenario B); closure of centres with a net loss of patients to other centres
      (scenario C); closure of centres meeting all three criteria in scenarios A, B,
      and C (scenario D); and closure of centres with high readmission rates (scenario 
      E). We used conditional logistic regression to predict probabilities of affected 
      patients moving to each of the remaining centres and the expected changes in
      travel time, multilevel logistic regression to predict 30-day emergency
      readmission rates, and linear regression to analyse associations between the
      expected extra travel time for patients whose centre is closed and five patient
      characteristics, including age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, comorbidity, and 
      rurality of the patients' residential areas (rural, urban [non-London], or
      London). We also quantified additional workload, defined as the number of extra
      patients reallocated to remaining centres. FINDINGS: Of the 11 888 patients, 4130
      (34.7%) were women, 5249 (44.2%) were aged 70 years and older, and 5005 (42.1%)
      had at least one comorbidity. Scenario A resulted in closures of 43 (26%) of the 
      163 rectal cancer surgery centres, affecting 1599 (13.5%) patients; scenario B
      resulted in closures of 112 (69%) centres, affecting 7029 (59.1%) patients;
      scenario C resulted in closures of 56 (34%) centres, affecting 3142 (26.4%)
      patients; scenario D resulted in closures of 24 (15%) centres, affecting 874
      (7.4%) patients; and scenario E resulted in closures of 16 (10%) centres,
      affecting 1000 (8.4%) patients. For each scenario, there was at least a two-times
      increase in predicted travel time for re-allocated patients with a mean increase 
      in travel time of 23 min; however, the extra travel time did not
      disproportionately affect vulnerable patient groups. All scenarios resulted in
      significant reductions in 30-day readmission rates (range 4-48%). Three hospitals
      in scenario A, 41 hospitals in in scenario B, 13 hospitals in scenario C, no
      hospitals in scenario D, and two hospitals in scenario E had to manage at least
      20 extra patients annually. INTERPRETATION: This health service planning model
      can be used to to guide complex decisions about the closure of centres and inform
      mitigation strategies. The approach could be applied across different country or 
      regional health-care systems for patients with cancer and other complex health
      conditons. FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research.

AB  - Deleterious somatic mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (DNMT3A) and TET
      mehtylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) are associated with clonal expansion of
      hematopoietic cells and higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we
      investigated roles of DNMT3A and TET2 in normal human monocyte-derived
      macrophages (MDM), in MDM isolated from individuals with DNMT3A or TET2
      mutations, and in macrophages isolated from human atherosclerotic plaques. We
      found that loss of function of DNMT3A or TET2 resulted in a type I interferon
      response due to impaired mitochondrial DNA integrity and activation of cGAS
      signaling. DNMT3A and TET2 normally maintained mitochondrial DNA integrity by
      regulating the expression of transcription factor A mitochondria (TFAM) dependent
      on their interactions with RBPJ and ZNF143 at regulatory regions of the TFAM
      gene. These findings suggest that targeting the cGAS-type I IFN pathway may have 
      therapeutic value in reducing risk of CVD in patients with DNMT3A or TET2
      mutations.

AB  - Brain macrophage populations include parenchymal microglia, border-associated
      macrophages, and recruited monocyte-derived cells; together, they control brain
      development and homeostasis but are also implicated in aging pathogenesis and
      neurodegeneration. The phenotypes, localization, and functions of each population
      in different contexts have yet to be resolved. We generated a murine brain
      myeloid scRNA-seq integration to systematically delineate brain macrophage
      populations. We show that the previously identified disease-associated microglia 
      (DAM) population detected in murine Alzheimer's disease models actually comprises
      two ontogenetically and functionally distinct cell lineages: embryonically
      derived triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2)-dependent DAM
      expressing a neuroprotective signature and monocyte-derived TREM2-expressing
      disease inflammatory macrophages (DIMs) accumulating in the brain during aging.
      These two distinct populations appear to also be conserved in the human brain.
      Herein, we generate an ontogeny-resolved model of brain myeloid cell
      heterogeneity in development, homeostasis, and disease and identify cellular
      targets for the treatment of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Germline PTEN variants (PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome [PHTS]) confer up to 85%
      lifetime risk of female breast cancer (BC). BCs arising in PHTS are clinically
      distinct from sporadic BCs, including younger age of onset, multifocality, and an
      increased risk of second primary BCs. Yet, there is no previous investigation
      into the underlying genomic landscape of this entity. We sought to address the
      hypothesis that BCs arising in PHTS have a distinct genomic landscape compared to
      sporadic counterparts. We performed and analyzed exome sequencing data from 44
      women with germline PTEN variants who developed BCs. The control cohort comprised
      of 497 women with sporadic BCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We
      demonstrate that PHTS-derived BCs have a distinct somatic mutational landscape
      compared to the sporadic counterparts, namely second somatic hits in PTEN,
      distinct mutational signatures, and increased genomic instability. The PHTS group
      had a significantly higher frequency of somatic PTEN variants compared to TCGA
      (22.7% versus 5.6%; odds ratio [OR] 4.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.21 to
      10.98; p < 0.001) and a lower mutational frequency in PIK3CA (22.7% versus 33.4%;
      OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.22; p = 0.15). Somatic variants in PTEN and PIK3CA were
      mutually exclusive in PHTS (p = 0.01) but not in TCGA. Our findings have
      important implications for the personalized management of PTEN-related BCs,
      especially in the context of more accessible genetic testing.

AB  - Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) are a powerful approach to
      identify genes whose expression is associated with complex disease risk. However,
      non-causal genes can exhibit association signals due to confounding by linkage
      disequilibrium (LD) patterns and eQTL pleiotropy at genomic risk regions, which
      necessitates fine-mapping of TWAS signals. Here, we present MA-FOCUS, a
      multi-ancestry framework for the improved identification of genes underlying
      traits of interest. We demonstrate that by leveraging differences in
      ancestry-specific patterns of LD and eQTL signals, MA-FOCUS consistently
      outperforms single-ancestry fine-mapping approaches with equivalent total sample 
      sizes across multiple metrics. We perform TWASs for 15 blood traits using
      genome-wide summary statistics (average nEA = 511 k, nAA = 13 k) and
      lymphoblastoid cell line eQTL data from cohorts of primarily European and African
      continental ancestries. We recapitulate evidence demonstrating shared genetic
      architectures for eQTL and blood traits between the two ancestry groups and
      observe that gene-level effects correlate 20% more strongly across ancestries
      than SNP-level effects. Lastly, we perform fine-mapping using MA-FOCUS and find
      evidence that genes at TWAS risk regions are more likely to be shared across
      ancestries than they are to be ancestry specific. Using multiple lines of
      evidence to validate our findings, we find that gene sets produced by MA-FOCUS
      are more enriched in hematopoietic categories than alternative approaches (p =
      2.36 x 10(-15)). Our work demonstrates that including and appropriately
      accounting for genetic diversity can drive more profound insights into the
      genetic architecture of complex traits.

      on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a
      wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms
      underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with
      expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin
      interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment 
      analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms
      the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective
      enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding
      sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In
      addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at
      GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants 
      with multiple layers of functional evidence. We highlight two of the prioritized 
      genes, CREBRF and RRBP1, which show convergent evidence across functional
      datasets supporting their roles in lipid biology.

AB  - Lgr5(+) intestinal stem cells (ISCs) depend on niche factors for their proper
      function. However, the source of these ISC niche factors and how they support
      ISCs in vivo remain controversial. Here, we report that ISCs depend on lymphatic 
      endothelial cells (LECs) and RSPO3(+)GREM1(+) fibroblasts (RGFs). In the
      intestine and colon, LECs are surrounded by RGFs and are located near ISCs at the
      crypt base. Both LECs and RGFs provide the critical ISC niche factor RSPO3 to
      support ISCs, where RSPO3 loss in both cell types drastically compromises ISC
      numbers, villi length, and repair after injury. In response to injury, LEC and
      RGF numbers expand and produce greater amounts of RSPO3 and other
      growth/angiocrine factors to foster intestinal repair. We propose that LECs
      represent a novel niche component for ISCs, which together with RGFs serve as the
      major in vivo RSPO3 source for ISCs in homeostasis and injury-mediated
      regeneration.

AB  - Intestinal homeostasis is underpinned by LGR5+ve crypt-base columnar stem cells
      (CBCs), but following injury, dedifferentiation results in the emergence of
      LGR5-ve regenerative stem cell populations (RSCs), characterized by fetal
      transcriptional profiles. Neoplasia hijacks regenerative signaling, so we
      assessed the distribution of CBCs and RSCs in mouse and human intestinal tumors. 
      Using combined molecular-morphological analysis, we demonstrate variable
      expression of stem cell markers across a range of lesions. The degree of CBC-RSC 
      admixture was associated with both epithelial mutation and microenvironmental
      signaling disruption and could be mapped across disease molecular subtypes. The
      CBC-RSC equilibrium was adaptive, with a dynamic response to acute selective
      pressure, and adaptability was associated with chemoresistance. We propose a
      fitness landscape model where individual tumors have equilibrated stem cell
      population distributions along a CBC-RSC phenotypic axis. Cellular plasticity is 
      represented by position shift along this axis and is influenced by
      cell-intrinsic, extrinsic, and therapeutic selective pressures.

AB  - Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a potentially unlimited
      resource for cell therapies, but the derivation of mature cell types remains
      challenging. The histone methyltransferase EZH1 is a negative regulator of
      lymphoid potential during embryonic hematopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate that EZH1
      repression facilitates in vitro differentiation and maturation of T cells from
      iPSCs. Coupling a stroma-free T cell differentiation system with
      EZH1-knockdown-mediated epigenetic reprogramming, we generated iPSC-derived T
      cells, termed EZ-T cells, which display a highly diverse T cell receptor (TCR)
      repertoire and mature molecular signatures similar to those of TCRalphabeta T
      cells from peripheral blood. Upon activation, EZ-T cells give rise to effector
      and memory T cell subsets. When transduced with chimeric antigen receptors
      (CARs), EZ-T cells exhibit potent antitumor activities in vitro and in xenograft 
      models. Epigenetic remodeling via EZH1 repression allows efficient production of 
      developmentally mature T cells from iPSCs for applications in adoptive cell
      therapy.

AB  - Human gut commensals are increasingly suggested to impact non-communicable
      diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), yet their targeted
      suppression remains a daunting unmet challenge. In four geographically distinct
      IBD cohorts (n = 537), we identify a clade of Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains,
      featuring a unique antibiotics resistance and mobilome signature, to be strongly 
      associated with disease exacerbation and severity. Transfer of clinical
      IBD-associated Kp strains into colitis-prone, germ-free, and colonized mice
      enhances intestinal inflammation. Stepwise generation of a lytic five-phage
      combination, targeting sensitive and resistant IBD-associated Kp clade members
      through distinct mechanisms, enables effective Kp suppression in colitis-prone
      mice, driving an attenuated inflammation and disease severity. Proof-of-concept
      assessment of Kp-targeting phages in an artificial human gut and in healthy
      volunteers demonstrates gastric acid-dependent phage resilience, safety, and
      viability in the lower gut. Collectively, we demonstrate the feasibility of
      orally administered combination phage therapy in avoiding resistance, while
      effectively inhibiting non-communicable disease-contributing pathobionts.

AB  - The surprising discovery that the diatomic gas nitric oxide (NO) is generated by 
      mammalian cells and serves to regulate a multitude of physiological processes has
      continued to fascinate biologists for almost four decades. The biochemistry of NO
      is complex, and novel insights into the control of NO biosynthesis and mechanisms
      of signal transduction are continuously emerging. NO is a key regulator of
      cardiovascular function, metabolism, neurotransmission, immunity, and more, and
      aberrant NO signaling is a central feature of many major disorders including
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Here, we discuss the basics of NO
      biology emphasizing recent advances in the field including novel means of
      increasing NO bioactivity with therapeutic and nutritional implications.

AB  - Immune checkpoint blockade is effective in treating many human cancers. In this
      issue of Cell, Luoma et al. show that tissue-resident memory T cells in head and 
      neck cancers rapidly respond to immune checkpoint blockade, and they identify
      specific CD8(+) T cells in pretreatment blood that predict pathologic tumor
      regression.

AB  - Glioblastoma is a lethal, diffusely invasive brain cancer that is robustly
      regulated by the activity of the brain itself, in part through neuron-to-glioma
      synaptic communication. Venkataramani et al. have conceptually advanced
      understanding of glioblastoma interactions with neural circuits, demonstrating
      that conduction of electrochemical signals via neuron-to-glioma synapses drives
      glioma invasion.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the experience of patients with relapsed and refractory 
      multiple myeloma (RRMM) receiving idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel), a B-cell
      maturation antigen-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy, in the
      pivotal, phase 2 KarMMa trial. METHODS: Optional semi-structured interviews
      before leukapheresis (pre-treatment) captured expectations and after ide-cel
      infusion (1, 2, and 3 months post-treatment), assessed treatment experience,
      ide-cel advantages/disadvantages, and health and well-being. In a mixed-method
      analysis, treatment experiences were categorized by clinical response status,
      health and well-being, and self-reported recovery after infusion. RESULTS:
      Pre-treatment interviews indicated unmet treatment needs. In post-treatment
      interviews, most patients reported the positives of ide-cel outweighed negatives 
      (69%, n = 27/39). Most common advantages of ide-cel were efficacy (18-64%),
      favorable side-effect profile (46-68%), and recovery time (13-18%); most common
      disadvantages were related to side effects (13-20%). When analyzed by clinical
      response, patients most often had stringent complete or very good partial
      response and improved health and well-being with mild or severe recovery from the
      infusion (27/58, 47%). Most patients with minimal clinical response reported mild
      infusion recovery (5/6, 83%). CONCLUSIONS: Patient interviews before ide-cel
      treatment showed unmet needs in triple-class exposed RRMM. Post-treatment
      experiences generally favored ide-cel versus previously received treatments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Suprabasin is a newly discovered protein linked to various human
      diseases including cancer. It may does have an effect on the development and
      expression of some non-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
      and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). BCC is the most common non-melanoma skin
      cancers worldwide, while SCC comes as the second in terms of prevalence. In
      certain cases, it is very important to distinguish between these two carcinomas
      from each other and from normal skin samples. This study was aimed at
      investigating the characteristics of suprabasin expression in squamous cell
      carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma and whether it can be used as a biomarker.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty control, ninety SCC and thirty BCC cases obtained
      from the archives of the Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Firat
      University, were examined by immunohistochemical staining for suprabasin.
      RESULTS: Increased suprabasin expression was observed in tumour tissues and
      normal skin samples in SCC. As the grade increased in SCC, suprabasin expression 
      decreased. No suprabasin expression was observed in the lesion area in BCC.
      CONCLUSION: Suprabasin can be reported as a biomarker for SCC and used to
      differentiate SCC from BCC. Expression of suprabasin in SCC can be used to
      determine grade. Absence of suprabasin expression in BCC can be used for
      differential diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the trend of
      cancer-related death rates between 2009 and 2019 in Turkey for all cancers
      combined and the five cancer types with the highest mortality: lung, stomach,
      pancreas, breast, and colon cancers. METHODS: Cancer mortality data were obtained
      from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) and standardized by age using
      the World Health Organization (WHO) standard population ratios. The change in
      cancer-related mortality over the years was evaluated using Joinpoint Regression 
      Analysis (JRA). RESULTS: Total cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually
      between 2009 and 2014 and decreased by 2.9% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p <
      0.05). Among men; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.4% annually between
      2009 and 2014 and decreased by 3.4% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05),
      stomach cancer-related deaths decreased by 5.1% annually between 2014 and 2019 (p
      < 0.05), colon cancer-related deaths increased by 5.8% annually between 2009 and 
      2015 and decreased by 3.3% annually between 2015 and 2019 (p < 0.05), pancreatic 
      cancer-related deaths increased annually by 5.6% in 2009-2013 (p < 0.05). Among
      women; lung cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and
      2016 (p < 0.05), stomach cancer-related deaths increased annually by 2.3% between
      2009 and 2014 and decreased annually by 4.5% between 2014 and 2019 (p < 0.05),
      colon cancer-related deaths increased by 2.5% annually between 2009 and 2017 (p <
      0.05), pancreatic cancer-related deaths increased by 7.4% annually between 2009
      and 2013 (p < 0.05) and breast cancer-related deaths increased by 2.2% annually
      between 2009 and 2019 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Mortality data in Turkey are
      collected only by TURKSTAT, which raises concern regarding the incompletion of
      the data. While this might lead to underestimation, the trend shows that there
      has been a decrease in total cancer-related deaths in Turkey. Pancreatic cancer, 
      on the other hand, gains a higher proportion in cancer-related deaths in Turkey
      as in the world. Increasing deaths from lung and breast cancer in women remind of
      the importance of tobacco control interventions and cancer screening programs.

AB  - Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, like Polybrominated diphenyl ethers
      (PBDEs), is suspected of playing a role in the occurrence of breast cancer.
      Moreover, there is growing evidence that food chemical contaminants, especially
      lipophilic ones such as PBDEs, could interact with different components of the
      diet. The objective of the present study was to assess the association between
      dietary intake of PBDEs and breast cancer risk in the French E3N cohort study,
      and to investigate the potential modification of this association by vegetable
      oil consumption. The study included 67879 women. Intakes of eight PBDEs were
      estimated using food consumption data from a validated semi-quantitative food
      frequency questionnaire, and food contamination levels measured by the French
      Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (ANSES). Cox
      proportional hazards models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HR) and 95%
      Confidence Intervals (CI) for the association between total PBDEs dietary intake 
      and breast cancer risk. Interaction measures for vegetable oil consumption were
      estimated on both additive and multiplicative scales. The women were followed for
      a maximum of 21.4 years, and 5 686 developed an incident breast cancer. A
      positive linear trend was highlighted between dietary intake of PBDEs in quintile
      groups and breast cancer risk, borderline with statistical significance (p-trend 
      = 0.06, HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 1.09 [0.99;1.20]). Interaction measures for
      vegetable oil consumption were significant in both additive and multiplicative
      scales. Higher effect sizes of the association were highlighted in high consumers
      of vegetable oil, i.e. >/=4.6 g/day (HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 1.23 [1.08; 1.40]), and
      almost no effect were found in low consumers (HRQ5vsQ1 and 95% CI: 0.97 [0.86;
      1.10]). Highlighting such interactions between nutrients and chemicals is crucial
      to develop efficient dietary recommendations to limit the negative health effects
      associated with exposure to food chemical contaminants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data for selpercatinib [a selective REarranged during Transfection
      (RET) inhibitor] from a single-arm trial (LIBRETTO-001, NCT03157128) in
      RET-fusion-positive advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were
      used in combination with external data sources to estimate comparative efficacy
      [objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival, and overall survival
      (OS)] in first- and second-line treatment settings. METHODS: Patient-level data
      were obtained from a de-identified real-world database. Patients diagnosed with
      advanced/metastatic NSCLC with no prior exposure to a RET inhibitor and one or
      more prior line of therapy were eligible. Additionally, individual patient-level 
      data (IPD) were obtained from the pemetrexed + platinum arm of KEYNOTE-189
      (NCT03950674, first line) and the docetaxel arm of REVEL (NCT01168973,
      post-progression). Patients were matched using entropy balancing, doubly robust
      method, and propensity score approaches. For patients with unknown/negative RET
      status, adjustment was made using a model fitted to IPD from a real-world
      database. RESULTS: In first-line unadjusted analyses of the real-world control,
      ORR was 87.2% for LIBRETTO-001 versus 66.7% for those with RET-positive NSCLC (P 
      = 0.06). After adjustment for unknown RET status and other patient
      characteristics, selpercatinib remained significantly superior versus the
      real-world control for all outcomes (all P < 0.001 except unadjusted
      RET-fusion-positive cohort). Similarly, outcomes were significantly improved
      versus clinical trial controls (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest
      improvement in outcomes associated with selpercatinib treatment versus the
      multiple external control cohorts, but should be interpreted with caution. Data
      were limited by the rarity of RET, lack of mature OS data, and uncertainty from
      assumptions to create control arms from external data.

AB  - The treatment efficacy of anticancer drugs in complex physiological environments 
      is still restricted by multi-drug resistance. To overcome this issue, a nanodrug 
      system of HA-SS@CuS@ZIF-8@TPZ&TBMACN (HSCZTT) that breaks through the
      detoxification barrier for tirapazamine (TPZ) delivery was developed in this
      manuscript. In addition to the photothermal effect aroused by CuS in HSCZTT,
      which can damage tumour cells, TBMACN with photostable fluorescence in the
      aggregate state can also generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) to
      destroy tumour cells. The continuous consumption of oxygen in PDT aggravates the 
      hypoxic environment of tumours, which further activates the TPZ released in the
      acidic microenvironment of the tumour to achieve apoptosis of the tumour cells.
      The HSCZTT can not only target the CD44 receptor overexpressed on the surface of 
      the cancer cell, but can also effectively consume a large amount of glutathione
      (GSH) through the disulphide bond-modified hyaluronic acid, which serves as a
      targeted disulphide bond, interfering with the detoxification barrier. Our
      finding presents a rational strategy to overcome multidrug resistance for the
      improved efficacy of anticancer drugs by the targeting of Hyaluronic acid (HA),
      release of the drug by the acid response of ZIF-8, breakthrough of the
      detoxification barrier, precise positioning of the drug release and combined
      treatment with phototherapy and hypoxia-activated chemotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of narrow-band imaging (NBI) for the
      post-treatment surveillance of patients with laryngeal cancers and to compare the
      diagnostic value of NBI with that of white light endoscopy (WLE). METHODS: We
      searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data, and CNKI databases.
      Study quality and potential bias were assessed by the updated Quality Assessment 
      of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool (QUADAS-2). Data analyses were performed
      with Meta-Disc. Publication bias was assessed by Deek's funnel plot asymmetry
      test. The protocol used in this article is in accordance with the PRISMA
      checklist. RESULTS: Seven studies including 628 lesions were included in this
      meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio for
      the NBI diagnosis of cancerous lesions were 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.84-0.96), 0.94 (95 %
      CI: 0.91-0.96), and 142.10 (95 % CI: 61.51-328.28), respectively. The area under 
      receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.97. Among the seven studies, three
      studies evaluated the diagnostic value of WLE, with a sensitivity of 0.53 (95 %
      CI: 0.38-0.69), a specificity of 0.94 (95 % CI: 0.90-0.97), and a diagnostic odds
      ratio of 14.75 (95 % CI: 1.72-126.87). The evaluation of heterogeneity,
      calculated per the diagnostic odds ratio, gave an I(2) of 0. No marked
      publication bias (p = 0.75) was found in our meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: NBI
      exhibits high diagnostic accuracy in the post-treatment follow-up of laryngeal
      cancer patients and is superior to that of traditional WLE.

AB  - BACH1 (Brca1-Associated C-terminal Helicase) is an important DNA damage response 
      factor, which is involved in DNA damage repair and maintenance of genomic
      stability. In this study, by using tandem protein affinity purification, we have 
      identified BCLAF1 as a novel functional partner of BACH1. BCLAF1 constitutively
      interacts with BACH1 regardless of DNA damage. However, in response to DNA
      damage, along with BACH1, BCLAF1 is recruited to the DNA damage sites and the
      recruitment of BCLAF1 was regulated by BACH1 and BRCA1. Interestingly, BCLAF1
      deficient cells are deficient for DSB-initiated HR, but RAD51 foci formation is
      intact following IR treatment. Taken together, these findings reveal that BCLAF1 
      is a functional binding partner of BACH1 playing a key role in DNA damage
      response.

AB  - The development of combination therapy that can modulate the tumor
      immunosuppressive microenvironment is highly desirable for cancer immunotherapy. 
      Icaritin (ICT), a hydrolytic product of icariin from genus Epimedium, has been
      used as an anti-cancer immunoregulatory agent for many types of cancers. Herein, 
      we design a novel therapeutic strategy for mice melanoma that combines systemic
      administration of icaritin with intratumoral injection of unmethylated
      cytosine-guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG). Icaritin induces tumor cell
      apoptosis and increases tumor immunogenicity. The combination of icaritin with
      CpG synergistically suppresses tumor growth and significantly prolonged survival 
      time of B16F10 melanoma bearing mice. importantly, the anti-tumor effects of this
      combination strategy are associated with the reversing of immunosuppressive
      microenvironment through increased recruitment of functional DCs and
      tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in tumors, leading to the infiltration of
      cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells expressing elevated levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha.
      Furthermore, the combination of icaritin with CpG augments the anti-tumor immune 
      response to anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade treatment. These results 
      support the combination of icaritin with CpG as a novel strategy to elicit
      effective T cell-mediated antitumor immune response.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study attempted to investigate the mechanism of miR-204-5p and
      its downstream gene in regulating bio-functions of esophageal cancer (EC).
      METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was performed to select the mature miRNAs,
      mRNAs, and clinical data of EC. The miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis was predicted
      through bioinformatics and used Dual-luciferase analysis to verify the
      interaction between miR-204-5p and APLN. qRT-PCR was applied to analyze
      expression of miR-204-5p and APLN mRNA. Western blot was utilized to detect APLN 
      protein expression. Functional assays like CCK-8, wound healing, Transwell, and
      stem cell sphere formation assays were launched to confirm proliferative,
      migratory, invasive and stemness of cells in different treatment groups. RESULTS:
      MiR-204-5p was lowly expressed while its target gene APLN was highly expressed in
      tumor tissues. Besides, miR-204-5p overexpression hindered proliferation,
      invasion, migration, and stemness of EC cells. Additionally, dual-luciferase
      assay verified the interaction of miR-204-5p and APLN. MiR-204-5p could
      downregulate APLN level and its overexpression reduced the effect of APLN on EC
      cell functions. CONCLUSION: Dysregulation of miR-204-5p/APLN axis was linked with
      malignant progression of EC. MiR-204-5p/APLN may be an underlying candidate for
      the design of anticarcinogens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) is a common malignant tumor. Apatinib in
      combination with other treatments has been used for BC; however, its safety and
      efficacy are not well-known. Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to
      assess the efficacy and safety of apatinib in the treatment of BC. METHODS:
      Studies comparing the effects of apatinib-based therapy versus control among BC
      patients were included. On January 21, 2022, a systematic search was performed in
      9 databases. The risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to
      estimate efficacy and safety. The I square value (I(2)) was used to assess
      heterogeneity. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was also conducted.
      Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger's and Begg's tests.
      RESULTS: A total of 31 studies including 2,258 BC patients were included. The
      results showed that apatinib group had a significant improvement in disease
      control rate (DCR, RR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.35-1.52, I(2) = 43.8%) and objective
      response rate (ORR, RR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.51-2.13, I(2) = 61.8%) compared to the 
      control group. Except for hemorrhage, hypertension, and hand-foot syndrome, the
      adverse events were similar between apatinib group and control group. Subgroup
      analyses found statistically significant differences in DCR in all subgroups
      except for apatinib combined with radiation therapy and with paclitaxel liposome 
      plus S1. For ORR, there were statistically significant differences in all
      subgroups except for the radiation therapy, and apatinib monotherapy subgroups.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study shown apatinib showed good efficacy and acceptable safety 
      in the treatment of BC patients. More high-quality randomized controlled trials
      from different regions and countries are needed to confirm our findings.

AB  - An elevated plasma level of soluble ST2 (sST2) is a risk biomarker for
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and death in patients receiving hematopoietic
      cell transplantation (HCT). sST2 functions as a trap for IL-33 and amplifies the 
      pro-inflammatory type 1 and 17 response while suppressing the tolerogenic type 2 
      and regulatory T cells activation during GVHD development. We previously
      identified small-molecule ST2 inhibitors particularly iST2-1 that reduces plasma 
      sST2 levels and improved survival in two animal models. Here, we reported the
      structure-activity relationship of the furanylmethylpyrrolidine-based ST2
      inhibitors based on iST2-1. Based on the biochemical AlphaLISA assay, we improved
      the activity of iST2-1 by 6-fold ( approximately 6 muM in IC50 values) in the
      inhibition of ST2/IL-33 and confirmed the activities of the compounds in a
      cellular reporter assay. To determine the inhibition of the alloreactivity in
      vitro, we used the mixed lymphocyte reaction assay to demonstrate that our ST2
      inhibitors decreased CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells proliferation and increased Treg
      population. The data presented in this work are critical to the development of
      ST2 inhibitors in future.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80% of
      lung cancer diagnoses across the world. Despite recent appreciable improvements
      in treatment plans for patients with NSCLC, the prognosis for those with the
      cancer still remains poor. Recently, a growing number of studies have shown that 
      N-myristoyltransferases (NMTs) may be critical in carcinogenesis, however, the
      functional and clinical significance of this pathway in NSCLC remains unclear and
      requires further research. METHODS: Initially, we evaluated the expression levels
      of NMT1 or NMT2 in a clinical cohort comprising of 303 paired primary NSCLC
      tissues and matched normal mucosae by using ELISA. We subsequently performed a
      tissue microarray analysis (TMA) to confirm its expression pattern in an
      independent validation cohort (n = 78). Then, we used a publicly available KM
      plotter database (n = 1921) to evaluate the prognostic impact of NMT1 and NMT2 in
      NSCLC. Lastly, a series of in-vitro molecular/cellular and animal experiments
      were performed for mechanistic understanding of the role of
      N-myristoyltransferases in NSCLC. RESULTS: Our ELISA data revealed that the
      expression level of NMT1 and NMT2 was down-regulated in tumor tissues (n = 303, P
      < 0.0001), which was confirmed in an independent validation cohort by TMA (n =
      78, P = 0.014 for NMT1 and P < 0.0001 for NMT2). On the other hand, patients with
      low expression of NMT1 or NMT2 had shorter overall survival (P = 0.013, HR = 0.85
      for NMT1; P = 0.00059, HR = 0.8, for NMT2). Mechanistically, we revealed that the
      interaction and co-localization of NMT1 and NMT2 in NSCLC, and N-terminus of NMT1
      and NMT2 was observed to be crucial for their interaction as well as for their
      catalytic activity. Moreover, we found that NMT1 can significantly promote the
      expression of NMT2 by enhancing its stability. We corroborated these findings by 
      performing functional assays in which the knockout of NMT1 and NMT2 resulted in
      enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as increased
      tumorxenograftgrowth. In addition, we identified miR-182 as a novel regulator of 
      both NMT1 and NMT2. More specifically, the overexpression or inhibition of
      miR-182 modulated globe N-myristoylation level, contributed to phenotypic
      alterations in NSCLS cells. CONCLUSIONS: NMT1 and NMT2 can act as potential tumor
      suppressors in NSCLC, and the inhibition of miR-182 expression or therapeutic
      NMTs replenishment may be a promising treatment option for patients with NSCLC.

AB  - This narrative review examines current evidence regarding sexual function in
      female cancer survivors, focusing on the impact of cancer treatments as well as
      the evaluation and management of sexual concerns in this population. Sexual
      dysfunction in female cancer survivors is prevalent, yet underdiagnosed and
      undertreated. Many healthcare professionals feel ill-equipped to address the
      sexual health needs of female cancer survivors. Multiple direct and indirect
      factors can contribute to sexual dysfunction in female cancer survivors,
      including effects on the hormonal milieu and physical and sexual well-being.
      Factors influencing sexual function after cancer may be multifaceted, warranting 
      a multidisciplinary approach to care. Validating and normalizing sexual health
      concerns and providing education and appropriate therapies, as well as timely
      referral to appropriate sexual health experts, are key to optimizing cancer
      survivorship care in women. Clinicians should, at a minimum, be aware of the
      various potential treatment modalities, taking into account contributing
      physical, psychological and interpersonal factors. Management of sexual health
      concerns should be individualized based on contributing factors.

TI  - Hyaluronate-Black Phosphorus-Upconversion Nanoparticle Complex for Non-invasive
      Theranosis of Skin Cancer.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00506 [doi]
AB  - Despite the wide investigation on black phosphorus (BP) for biophotonic
      applications, the finite depth of light penetration has limited further
      development of BP-based photomedicines. Here, we developed a
      hyaluronate-BP-upconversion nanoparticle (HA-BP-UCNP) complex for near-infrared
      (NIR) light-mediated multimodal theranosis of skin cancer with photoacoustic (PA)
      bioimaging, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT). In
      contrast to the conventional BP-based skin cancer theranosis, the HA-BP-UCNP
      complex could be non-invasively delivered into the tumor tissue to induce the
      cancer cell apoptosis upon NIR light irradiation. The PA imaging of BP
      successfully visualized the non-invasive transdermal delivery of the HA-BP-UCNP
      complex into the mice skin. HA in the complex facilitated the transdermal
      delivery of BP into the tumor tissue under the skin. Upon 980 nm NIR light
      irradiation, the UCNP converted the light to UV-blue light to generate reactive
      oxygen species by sensitizing BP in the HA-BP-UCNP complex for PDT. Remarkably,
      808 nm NIR irradiation with PTT triggered the apoptosis of tumor cells. Taken
      together, we could confirm the feasibility of the HA-BP-UCNP complex for NIR
      light-mediated multimodal theranosis of skin cancers.

TI  - An immunogenic model of KRAS-mutant lung cancer enables evaluation of targeted
      therapy and immunotherapy combinations.

AB  - Mutations in oncogenes such as KRAS and EGFR cause a high proportion of lung
      cancers. Drugs targeting these proteins cause tumor regression but ultimately
      fail to elicit cures. As a result, there is an intense interest in how to best
      combine targeted therapies with other treatments, such as immunotherapies.
      However, preclinical systems for studying the interaction of lung tumors with the
      host immune system are inadequate, in part due to the low tumor mutational burden
      in genetically engineered mouse models. Here we set out to develop mouse models
      of mutant KRAS-driven lung cancer with an elevated tumor mutational burden by
      expressing the human DNA cytosine deaminase, APOBEC3B, to mimic the mutational
      signature seen in human lung cancer. This failed to substantially increase clonal
      tumor mutational burden and autochthonous tumors remained refractory to
      immunotherapy. However, establishing clonal cell lines from these tumors enabled 
      the generation of an immunogenic syngeneic transplantation model of KRAS-mutant
      lung adenocarcinoma that was sensitive to immunotherapy. Unexpectedly, anti-tumor
      immune responses were not directed against neoantigens but instead targeted
      derepressed endogenous retroviral antigens. The ability of KRASG12C inhibitors to
      cause regression of KRASG12C-expressing tumors was markedly potentiated by the
      adaptive immune system, highlighting the importance of using immunocompetent
      models for evaluating targeted therapies. Overall, this model provides a unique
      opportunity for the study of combinations of targeted and immunotherapies in
      immune-hot lung cancer.

TI  - Satisfaction with Clinician-Led Germline Genetic Counseling in Patients with
      Prostate Cancer.
PG  - 101097JU0000000000002865
LID - 10.1097/JU.0000000000002865 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Indications for germline testing in prostate cancer patients have
      expanded substantially over the past decade. With a near-universal shortage of
      genetic counselors and increasing demand, increased access to genetic counseling 
      is crucial. We sought to prospectively implement and assess a clinician-led
      approach to genetic counseling and testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with 
      metastatic or localized prostate cancer meeting NCCN criteria for consideration
      of genetic testing were offered pre-test genetic counseling by their urologist or
      medical oncologist as part of their routine clinical care and concurrently
      approached for enrollment in the "Germline Genetics in Prostate Cancer Study."
      Consented patients filled out a post-counseling survey using validated
      instruments to assess the quality of counseling. For patients who elected to
      undergo genetic testing, an additional validated questionnaire was completed
      following disclosure of results. The primary outcome was the proportion of
      patients undergoing testing, with a target >60% of patients. The secondary
      outcome was overall satisfaction with counseling, with a target >85% of patients.
      RESULTS: 275 patients enrolled, and 203 patients elected to undergo genetic
      testing. Post-counseling surveys were obtained from 265 patients, and
      post-genetic testing surveys were obtained from 132 patients. Patient
      satisfaction was high, with 98% of patients reporting being satisfied with the
      overall quality of pre-test counseling, and 74% of patients elected to undergo
      genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the effectiveness of
      clinician-led genetic counseling in prostate cancer. With clinician training,
      this approach can be utilized to expand access to appropriate germline genetic
      testing.

AB  - The resulting pandemic from the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2,
      SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), continues to exert a strain on worldwide health services
      due to the incidence of hospitalization and mortality associated with infection. 
      The aim of clinical services throughout the period of the pandemic and likely
      beyond to endemic infections as the situation stabilizes is to enhance safety
      aspects to mitigate transmission of COVID-19 while providing a high quality of
      service to all patients (COVID-19 positive and negative) while still upholding
      excellent medical standards. In order to achieve this, new strategies of clinical
      service operation are essential. Researchers have published peer-reviewed
      reference materials such as guidelines, experiences and advice to manage the
      resulting issues from the unpredictable challenges presented by the pandemic.
      There is a range of international guidance also from professional medical
      organizations, including best practice and advice in order to help imaging
      facilities adjust their standard operating procedures and workflows in line with 
      infection control principles. This work provides a broad review of the main
      sources of advice and guidelines for radiology and nuclear medicine facilities
      during the pandemic, and also of rapidly emerging advice and local/national
      experiences as facilities begin to resume previously canceled non-urgent services
      as well as effects on imaging research.

TI  - Implementation and Impact of Choosing Wisely Recommendations in Oncology.
PG  - OP2200130
LID - 10.1200/OP.22.00130 [doi]
AB  - The Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign, launched in 2012, includes oncology-specific
      recommendations to promote evidence-based care and deimplementation of low-value 
      practices. However, it is unclear to what extent the campaign has prompted
      practice change. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the uptake
      of cancer-specific CW recommendations focusing on the period before the
      declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used Grimshaw's deimplementation
      framework to thematically group the findings and extracted information on
      implementation strategies, barriers, and facilitators from articles reporting on 
      active implementation. In the 98 articles addressing 32 unique recommendations,
      most reported on passive changes in adherence pre-post publication of CW
      recommendations. Use of active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer and
      reduction in staging imaging for early breast cancer were the most commonly
      evaluated recommendations. Most articles assessing passive changes in adherence
      pre-post CW publication reported improvement. All articles evaluating active
      implementation (10 of 98) reported improved compliance (range: 3%-73%
      improvement). Most common implementation strategies included provider education
      and/or stakeholder engagement. Preconceived views and reluctance to adopt new
      practices were common barriers; common facilitators included the use of
      technology and provider education to increase provider buy-in. Given the limited 
      uptake of oncology-specific CW recommendations thus far, more attention toward
      supporting active implementation is needed. Effective adoption of CW likely
      requires a multipronged approach that includes building stakeholder buy-in
      through engagement and education, using technology-enabled forced functions to
      facilitate change along with policy and reimbursement models that disincentivize 
      low-value care. Professional societies have a role to play in supporting this
      next phase of CW.

AB  - AZD4625 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of oncogenic
      KRASG12C as demonstrated in cellular assays and in vivo in preclinical cell-line 
      and patient derived xenograft models. In vitro and cellular assays have shown
      selective binding and inhibition of the KRASG12C mutant isoform, which carries a 
      glycine to cysteine mutation at residue 12, with no binding and inhibition of
      wild type RAS or isoforms carrying non-KRASG12C mutations. The pharmacology of
      AZD4625 shows that it has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit to
      patients with KRASG12C mutant cancer as either a monotherapy treatment or in
      combination with other targeted drug agents.

TI  - Partial Breast Irradiation Versus Whole Breast Irradiation for Early Breast
      Cancer Patients in a Randomized Phase III Trial: The Danish Breast Cancer Group
      Partial Breast Irradiation Trial.
PG  - JCO2200451
LID - 10.1200/JCO.22.00451 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: On the basis of low risk of local recurrence in elderly patients with
      breast cancer after conservative surgery followed by whole breast irradiation
      (WBI), the Danish Breast Cancer Group initiated the noninferiority external-beam 
      partial breast irradiation (PBI) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
      NCT00892814). We hypothesized that PBI was noninferior to WBI regarding breast
      induration. METHODS: Patients operated with breast conservation for relatively
      low-risk breast cancer were randomly assigned to WBI versus PBI, and all had 40
      Gy/15 fractions. The primary end point was 3-year grade 2-3 breast induration.
      RESULTS: In total, 865 evaluable patients (434 WBI and 431 PBI) were enrolled
      between 2009 and 2016. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (morbidity) and 7.6 years
      (locoregional recurrence). The 3-year rate of induration was 9.7% for WBI and
      5.1% for PBI, P = .014. Large breast size was significantly associated with
      induration with a 3-year incidence of 13% (WBI) and 6% (PBI) for large-breasted
      patients versus 6% (WBI) and 5% (PBI) for small-breasted patients. PBI showed no 
      increased risk of dyspigmentation, telangiectasia, edema, or pain, and patient
      satisfaction was high. Letrozole and smoking did not increase the risk of
      radiation-associated morbidity. Sixteen patients had a locoregional recurrence
      (six WBI and 10 PBI), P = .28, 20 patients had a contralateral breast cancer, and
      eight patients had distant failure (five WBI and three PBI). A nonbreast second
      cancer was detected in 73 patients (8.4%), and there was no difference between
      groups. CONCLUSION: External-beam PBI for patients with low-risk breast cancer
      was noninferior to WBI in terms of breast induration. Large breast size was a
      risk factor for radiation-associated induration. Few recurrences were detected
      and unrelated to PBI.

TI  - Sirpiglenastat (DRP-104) Induces Anti-tumor Efficacy Through Direct, Broad
      Antagonism of Glutamine Metabolism and Stimulation of the Innate & Adaptive
      Immune Systems.
LID - MCT-22-0282 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0282 [doi]
AB  - Glutamine is a conditionally essential amino acid consumed by rapidly
      proliferating cancer cells, which deprives the same fuel from immune cells and
      contributes to tumor immune evasion. As such, the broad antagonism of glutamine
      in tumors and the tumor microenvironment may lead to direct antitumor activity
      and stimulation of antitumoral immune responses. DRP-104 (sirpiglenastat) was
      designed as a novel prodrug of the broad-acting glutamine antagonist
      6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON). DRP-104 is an inactive form that is
      preferentially enzymatically converted to DON within tumors. Metabolomic
      profiling of tumors treated with DRP-104 revealed widespread changes indicative
      of the disruption of tumor anabolism and canonical cancer metabolism pathways;
      including altered glutamine metabolism while several immuno-suppressive
      metabolites were decreased. Gene expression profiling revealed broad
      immunological modulation, confirmed by flow cytometry indicating that DRP-104
      treatment resulted in substantial and broad changes in various immune cell
      infiltrates, such as increased TIL, T, NK and NKT cells. Functionally, T cells
      became more proliferative and less exhausted; TAMs were polarized to the M1
      phenotype; MDSCs and pro-tumorigenic proteins were decreased in TME. Finally,
      DRP-104 demonstrated significant antitumor activity as a monotherapy, which was
      further enhanced in combination with checkpoint blockade therapies, leading to
      improved survival and long-term durable cures. In summary, DRP-104 broadly
      remodels the tumor microenvironment by inducing extensive tumor metabolism
      effects and enhancing the infiltration and function of multiple immune cells
      distinct from those obtained by checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This unique
      mechanism of action supports the ongoing clinical development of DRP-104 alone
      and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities in Delay to Initiation of
      Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy.
PG  - OP2200104
LID - 10.1200/OP.22.00104 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Delays in initiation of radiotherapy may contribute to inferior
      oncologic outcomes that are more commonly observed in minoritized populations in 
      the United States. We aimed to examine inequities associated with delayed
      initiation of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      National Cancer Database was queried to identify the 10 cancer sites most
      commonly treated with IMRT. Interval to initiation of treatment (IIT) was broken 
      into quartiles for each disease site, with the 4(th) quartile classified as
      delayed. Multivariable logistic regression for delayed IIT was performed for each
      disease site using clinical and demographic covariates. Differences in magnitude 
      of delay between subsets of patients stratified by race and insurance status were
      evaluated using two-sample t-tests. RESULTS: Among patients (n = 350,425) treated
      with IMRT between 2004 and 2017, non-Hispanic Black (NHB), Hispanic, and Asian
      patients were significantly more likely to have delayed IIT with IMRT for nearly 
      all disease sites compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. NHB, Hispanic,
      and Asian patients had significantly longer median IIT than NHW patients (NHB 87 
      days, P < .01; Hispanic 76 days, P < .01; Asian 74 days, P < .01; and NHW 67
      days). NHW, Hispanic, and Asian patients with private insurance had shorter
      median IIT than those with Medicare (P < .01); however, NHB patients with private
      insurance had longer IIT than those with Medicare (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Delays
      in initiation of IMRT in NHB, Hispanic, and Asian patients may contribute to the 
      known differences in cancer outcomes and warrant further investigation,
      particularly to further clarify the role of different insurance policies in
      delays in advanced modality radiotherapy.

TI  - Long Term Outcomes in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia
      Treated with Vemurafenib Monotherapy.
LID - blood.2022016183 [pii]
LID - 10.1182/blood.2022016183 [doi]
AB  - Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare chronic B cell lymphoproliferative disorder
      characterized by high prevalence of BRAF V600E mutation.1,2 Purine nucleoside
      analogues can achieve an overall response rate (ORR) of 90 to 100% and complete
      responses (CR) of 80 to 95% and remain the mainstay of first-line treatment in
      HCL.3,4 However, approximately 30-40% patients will experience recurrent disease 
      and relapse-free survival rates decrease with repeated courses of purine
      analogue-based treatments with cumulative myelotoxicity and immune
      suppression.5,6 The genetic basis of HCL was first uncovered a decade ago when
      Tiacci and colleagues reported that BRAF V600E is a key mutation in HCL,7 a
      finding that was further validated by subsequent studies.8,9 Based on these
      findings, we conducted a multicenter phase 2 clinical trial in the U.S.
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of vemurafenib, an oral BRAF inhibitor, in
      patients with relapsed/ refractory (R/R) HCL. We previously published the initial
      outcome of 26 U.S. patients together with the Italian study conducted by Tiacci
      et al.7 Vemurafenib monotherapy induced 96-100% ORR and 35-42% CR rates in both
      studies. With a median follow-up duration of 11.7 months, we observed relapses in
      29% of the patients but the long-term clinical outcome and response or acquired
      resistance to vemurafenib retreatment have not been previously reported. Herein, 
      we report the long-term follow-up data of the entire patient cohort in the
      completed U.S. clinical trial (NCT01711632) including the ORR, relapse free
      survival, clinical factors associated with improved survival as well as outcomes 
      after retreatment with vemurafenib or alternative agents.

TI  - Scalable and Reconfigurable Green Electronic Textiles with Personalized Comfort
      Management.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c04252 [doi]
AB  - Electronic textiles, inherited with the wearability of conventional clothes, are 
      deemed fundamental for emerging wearable electronics, particularly in the
      Internet of Things era. However, the electronic waste produced by electronic
      textiles will further exacerbate the severe pollution in traditional textiles.
      Here, we develop a large-scale green electronic textile using renewable bio-based
      polylactic acid and sustainable eutectic gallium-indium alloys. The green
      electronic textile is extremely abrasion resistant and can degrade naturally in
      the environment even if abrasion produces infinitesimal amounts of microplastics.
      The mass loss and performance change rates of the reconstituted green electronic 
      textiles are all below 5.4% after going through the full-cycle recycling
      procedure. This green electronic textile delivers high physiological comfort
      (including electronic comfort and thermal-moisture comfort), enables wireless
      power supply (without constraints by, e.g., wires and ports), has 2 orders of
      magnitude better air and moisture permeability than the body requires, and can
      lower skin temperature by 5.2 degrees C.

TI  - Transient Inhibition of Trastuzumab-Tumor Binding to Overcome the "Binding-Site
      Barrier" and Improve the Efficacy of a Trastuzumab-Gelonin Immunotoxin.
LID - MCT-22-0192 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-22-0192 [doi]
AB  - We have recently shown that co-administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with
      anti-idiotypic distribution enhancers (AIDEs) that inhibit mAb binding to tumor
      antigens enabled increased intra-tumoral mAb distribution and increased efficacy 
      of an antibody-drug conjugate (trastuzumab emtansine, T-DM1). In the present
      work, a PK/PD model was applied to predict the impact of this optimization
      strategy on the within-tumor distribution and anti-tumor efficacy of
      trastuzumab-gelonin, where the released payload (gelonin) is expected to exhibit 
      negligible bystander activity. Immunofluorescence histology was used to
      investigate trastuzumab-gelonin distribution in solid tumors following dosing
      with or without co-administration of anti-trastuzumab AIDEs. Anti-tumor efficacy 
      of trastuzumab-gelonin, with or without co-administration of AIDEs, was also
      evaluated in tumor-bearing mice. Trastuzumab-gelonin efficiently induced
      cytotoxicity when applied to NCI-N87 cells in culture (IC50: 0.224+/-0.079 nM).
      PK/PD simulations predicted that anti-idiotypic single-domain antibodies AIDEs
      with dissociation rate constants between 0.03-0.2 hour-1 would provide optimal
      enhancement of trastuzumab-gelonin efficacy. LE8 and 1HE, anti-trastuzumab AIDEs,
      were selected for evaluation in vivo. Co-administration of trastuzumab-gelonin
      with the inhibitors increased the portion of tumor area that stained positive for
      trastuzumab-gelonin by 58% (p=0.0059). Additionally, LE8 or 1HE co-administration
      improved trastuzumab-gelonin efficacy in NCI-N87 xenograft bearing mice by
      increasing the percent increase in life span (%ILS) from 27.8% (for
      trastuzumab-gelonin administered alone) to 62.5% when administered with LE8
      (p=0.0007) or 83.3% (p=0.0007) when administered with 1HE. These findings support
      the hypothesis that transient, competitive inhibition of mAb-tumor binding can
      improve the intra-tumoral distribution and efficacy of immunotoxins when applied 
      for treatment of solid tumors.

AB  - The next-generation antiandrogen drugs such as enzalutamide and abiraterone
      extend survival times and improve quality of life in patients with advanced
      prostate cancer. However, resistance to both drugs occurs frequently through
      mechanisms which are incompletely understood. Wnt signaling, particularly through
      Wnt5a, plays vital roles in promoting prostate cancer progression and induction
      of resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. Development of novel strategies
      targeting Wnt5a to overcome resistance is an urgent need. In this study, we
      demonstrated that Wnt5a/FZD2-mediated non-canonical Wnt pathway is overexpressed 
      in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer. In patient databases, both the levels 
      of Wnt5a and FZD2 expression are upregulated upon the development of enzalutamide
      resistance and correlate with higher Gleason score, biochemical recurrence and
      metastatic status, and with shortened disease-free survival duration. Blocking
      Wnt5a/FZD2 signal transduction not only diminished the activation of
      non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, but also suppressed the constitutively
      activated AR and AR variants. Furthermore, we developed a novel bioengineered
      BREA-Wnt5a siRNA construct and demonstrated that inhibition of Wnt5a expression
      by the BREA-Wnt5a siRNA significantly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced
      enzalutamide treatment in vivo. These results indicate that Wnt5a/FZD2 signal
      pathway plays critical role in promoting enzalutamide resistance and targeting
      this pathway by BREA-Wnt5a siRNA can be developed as a potential therapy to treat
      advanced prostate cancer.

AB  - Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important post-transcriptional
      modification commonly involved in tumor development. However, the functional
      roles of APA in tumor immunity remain largely unknown. Here, we performed an
      in-depth analysis of the 3'UTR usage of protein-coding genes and tumor immune
      response in 10,303 tumor samples across 31 cancer types to develop the
      immune-related APA event (ImmAPA) score pipeline, an integrated algorithm to
      characterize the regulatory landscape of APA events in cancer immunity-related
      pathways. Tumor-specific ImmAPAs that strongly correlate with immune cell
      infiltration and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment-related biomarkers
      were identified. Among these ImmAPAs, the top-ranking COL1A1 3'UTR usage was
      strongly associated with worse prognosis and tumor immune evasion. Furthermore, a
      machine learning approach to construct an ICB-related ImmAPA score model
      predicted immunotherapy efficacy. Overall, the characterization of immune-related
      APA that correspond to tumor progression and tumor immunity highlights the
      clinical utility of APA events as potential biomarkers in cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT: A 58-year-old man with large penile wound and enlarged regional lymph
      node was suspected of having disseminated penile cancer. FDG PET/CT for primary
      staging showed high FDG uptake on penis and in several enlarged lymph nodes.
      However, biopsies revealed no signs of malignancy, but ulceration, inflammation, 
      fibrosis, and spirochetes. Furthermore, Wassermann test was positive. The patient
      was then treated for syphilis. To our knowledge, this is the first report on FDG 
      PET/CT in a patient suspected of having penile cancer that turned out to be
      syphilis. Thus, syphilis can be added to the list of benign pitfalls in FDG
      PET/CT.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Dysregulation of the cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-RB pathway, which leads to
      uncontrolled cell proliferation, is frequently observed in breast cancer.
      Recently, 3 CDK4/6 inhibitors have been FDA approved as first-line treatment for 
      patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor
      2-negative advanced breast cancer. Despite promising clinical results, the
      metabolic response to treatment with these new drugs has not been elaborately
      demonstrated yet. Herein, we presented a patient with hormone receptor-positive, 
      human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer who demonstrated 
      a complete metabolic response on 18F-FDG PET/CT to treatment with a CDK4/6
      inhibitor (ribociclib).

AB  - ABSTRACT: Herein, we present the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT and 68Ga-FAPI-4 PET/CT
      of a patient with metastatic Kaposi sarcoma. A 47-year-old man with suspected
      gastric cancer was referred to 18F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosis and staging. PET/CT
      detected increased 18F-FDG uptake in metastatic lymphadenopathies and liver
      lesions. 68Ga-FAPI-4 PET/CT was performed for ongoing clinical trial. Although
      68Ga-FAPI-4 PET/CT may be a better alternative than 18F-FDG for the imaging of
      primary tumoral infiltrations in the stomach, 18F-FDG seems to be a more useful
      agent for the Kaposi sarcoma in determining the extent of the disease and the
      localization of metastatic lesions.

AB  - ABSTRACT: A 69-year-old man with a known history of gastric and prostate
      adenocarcinoma was referred to 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)
      PET/CT for restaging due to biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. 68Ga-PSMA 
      PET/CT revealed tracer accumulation in the primary prostatic lesion, lymph node, 
      bone metastases, and brain lesion, which was later confirmed on biopsy to be

AB  - Exosomes show great potential in diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
      Inspired by human innate immune defense, herein, we report engineered
      exosomes-derived from monocytic cells treated with immunomodulating compounds
      1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and CYP24A1 inhibitor VID400 which are slowly
      released from electrospun nanofiber matrices. These engineered exosomes contain
      significantly more cathelicidin/LL-37 when compared with exosomes-derived from
      either untreated cells or Cathelicidin Human Tagged ORF Clone transfected cells. 
      In addition, such exosomes exhibit multiple biological functions evidenced by
      killing bacteria, facilitating human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube
      formation, and enhancing skin cell proliferation and migration. Taken together,
      the engineered exosomes developed in this study could be used as therapeutics
      alone or in combination with other biomaterials for effective infection
      management, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. This article is protected by

TI  - Genome Engineering for Next-Generation Cellular Immunotherapies.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.2c00340 [doi]
AB  - Over the past decade, cellular immunotherapies such as CAR-T, TCR-T, and NK cell 
      therapies have achieved tremendous success in cancer treatment. However, various 
      challenges and obstacles remain, including antigen escape, immunosuppression in
      the tumor microenvironment, toxicities, and on-target off-tumor effects. Recent
      strategies for overcoming these roadblocks have included the use of genome
      engineering. Multiplexed CRISPR-Cas and synthetic biology approaches facilitate
      the development of cell therapies with higher potency and sophisticated modular
      control; they also offer a toolkit for allogeneic therapy development.
      Engineering approaches have targeted genetic modifications to enhance long-term
      persistence through cytokine modulation, knockout of genes mediating
      immunosuppressive signals, and genes such as the endogenous TCR and MHC-I that
      elicit adverse host-graft interactions in an allogeneic context. Genome
      engineering approaches for other immune cell types are also being explored, such 
      as CAR macrophages and CAR-NK cells. Future therapeutic development of cellular
      immunotherapies may also be guided by novel target discovery through unbiased
      CRISPR genetic screening approaches.

      Study of Breast-Cancer Survivors.

AB  - Stress can lead to depression, in part because of activation of inflammatory
      mechanisms. It is therefore critical to identify resilience factors that can
      buffer against these effects, but no research to date has evaluated whether
      psychosocial resilience mitigates the effects of stress on
      inflammation-associated depressive symptoms. We therefore examined psychosocial
      resources known to buffer against stress in a longitudinal study of women with
      breast cancer (N = 187). Depressive symptoms and inflammation were measured over 
      a 2-year period extending from after diagnosis into survivorship. Cancer-related 
      stress and psychosocial resources-social support, optimism, positive affect,
      mastery, self-esteem, and mindfulness-were measured after diagnosis. As
      hypothesized, women who reported having more psychosocial resources showed weaker
      associations between stress and depressive symptoms and weaker associations
      between stress and inflammation-related depressive symptoms. Results highlight
      the importance of psychosocial resilience by demonstrating a relationship between
      psychosocial resources and sensitivity to inflammation-associated depressive
      symptoms.

TI  - Widespread hydroxylation of unstructured lysine-rich protein domains by JMJD6.
PG  - e2201483119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2201483119 [doi]
AB  - The Jumonji domain-containing protein JMJD6 is a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent
      dioxygenase associated with a broad range of biological functions. Cellular
      studies have implicated the enzyme in chromatin biology, transcription, DNA
      repair, mRNA splicing, and cotranscriptional processing. Although not all studies
      agree, JMJD6 has been reported to catalyze both hydroxylation of lysine residues 
      and demethylation of arginine residues. However, despite extensive study and
      indirect evidence for JMJD6 catalysis in many cellular processes, direct
      assignment of JMJD6 catalytic substrates has been limited. Examination of a
      reported site of proline hydroxylation within a lysine-rich region of the tandem 
      bromodomain protein BRD4 led us to conclude that hydroxylation was in fact on
      lysine and catalyzed by JMJD6. This prompted a wider search for JMJD6-catalyzed
      protein modifications deploying mass spectrometric methods designed to improve
      the analysis of such lysine-rich regions. Using lysine derivatization with
      propionic anhydride to improve the analysis of tryptic peptides and nontryptic
      proteolysis, we report 150 sites of JMJD6-catalyzed lysine hydroxylation on 48
      protein substrates, including 19 sites of hydroxylation on BRD4. Most
      hydroxylations were within lysine-rich regions that are predicted to be
      unstructured; in some, multiple modifications were observed on adjacent lysine
      residues. Almost all of the JMJD6 substrates defined in these studies have been
      associated with membraneless organelle formation. Given the reported roles of
      lysine-rich regions in subcellular partitioning by liquid-liquid phase
      separation, our findings raise the possibility that JMJD6 may play a role in
      regulating such processes in response to stresses, including hypoxia.

      of halichondrin B.
PG  - e2208938119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2208938119 [doi]
AB  - A unified synthetic route for the total syntheses of eribulin and a macrolactam
      analog of halichondrin B is described. The key to the success of the current
      synthetic approach includes the employment of our reverse approach for the
      construction of cyclic ether structural motifs and a modified intramolecular
      cyclization reaction between alkyl iodide and aldehyde functionalities to
      establish the all-carbon macrocyclic framework of eribulin. These syntheses,
      together with our previous work on the total syntheses of halichondrin B and

AB  - Response rates to immunotherapy in solid tumors remain low due in part to the
      elevated prevalence of terminally exhausted T cells, a hypofunctional
      differentiation state induced through persistent antigen and stress signaling.
      However, the mechanisms promoting progression to terminal exhaustion in the tumor
      remain undefined. Using the low-input chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
      method CUT&RUN, we profiled the histone modification landscape of
      tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells throughout differentiation. We found that
      terminally exhausted T cells had unexpected chromatin features that limit their
      transcriptional potential. Terminally exhausted T cells had a substantial
      fraction of active chromatin, including active enhancers enriched for bZIP/AP-1
      transcription factor motifs that lacked correlated gene expression, which was
      restored by immunotherapeutic costimulatory signaling. Reduced transcriptional
      potential was also driven by an increase in histone bivalency, which we linked
      directly to hypoxia exposure. Enforced expression of the hypoxia-insensitive
      histone demethylase Kdm6b was sufficient to overcome hypoxia, increase function, 
      and promote antitumor immunity. Our study reveals the specific epigenetic changes
      mediated by histone modifications during T cell differentiation that support
      exhaustion in cancer, highlighting that their altered function is driven by
      improper costimulatory signals and environmental factors. These data suggest that
      even terminally exhausted T cells may remain competent for transcription in
      settings of increased costimulatory signaling and reduced hypoxia.

TI  - Size-dependent activation of CAR-T cells.
PG  - eabl3995
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.abl3995 [doi]
AB  - As the targets of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells expand to a variety of 
      cancers, autoimmune diseases, viral infections, and fibrosis, there is an
      increasing demand for identifying new antigens and designing new CARs that can be
      effectively activated. However, the rational selection of antigens and the design
      of CARs are limited by a lack of knowledge regarding the molecular mechanism by
      which CARs are activated by antigens. Here, we present data supporting a "size
      exclusion" model explaining how antigen signals are transmitted across the plasma
      membrane to activate the intracellular domains of CARs. In this model, antigen
      engagement with CAR results in a narrow intermembrane space that physically
      excludes CD45, a bulky phosphatase, out of the CAR zone, thus favoring CAR
      phosphorylation by kinases, which further triggers downstream pathways leading to
      T cell activation. Aligned with this model, increasing the size of CAR
      extracellular domains diminished CAR-T activation both in vitro and in a mouse
      lymphoma model; membrane-proximal epitopes activated CAR-Ts better than
      membrane-distal epitopes. Moreover, increasing the size of CD45 by antibody
      conjugation enhanced the activation of CARs that recognize membrane-distal
      epitopes. Consistently, CAR-Ts expressing CD45RABC, the larger isoform, were
      activated to a higher level than those expressing a smaller isoform CD45RO.
      Together, our work revealed that CAR-T activation depends on the size difference 
      between the CAR-antigen pair and CD45; the size of CAR, antigen, and CD45 can
      thus be targets for tuning CAR-T activation.

PG  - e0272809
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272809 [doi]
AB  - In the United States (U.S.), a hepatitis E virus (HEV) seroprevalence between 6
      and 21% has been described, with a decreasing trend. We aimed to investigate HEV 
      infection in the U.S. population from 2009 to 2016, and examine the differences
      in seroprevalence using different assays. We used data from the National Health
      and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-CDC) to estimate HEV seroprevalence and 
      analyze demographic variables related to the infection. Additionally, we compared
      4 serological tests used. The estimated HEV seroprevalence between 2009-2016 was 
      6.1% (95% CI: 5.6%-7.0%) for IgG and 1.02% (0.8%-1.2%) for IgM. Higher HEV IgG
      prevalences were found in older people, females, non-Hispanic Asians and those
      born outside of the U.S. The in-house immunoassay and the Wantai HEV-IgG ELISA
      presented the highest sensitivity values in the tested population. The highest
      specificity values corresponded to the DSI-EIA-ANTI-HEV-IgG assay. The kappa
      statistical values showed concordances no greater than 0.64 between the assays.
      HEV prevalence in our study was similar to previously reported, and a decline in 
      the prevalence was observed through the NHANES assessments (from 1988 to 2016).
      The sensitivity and specificity of the assays varied widely, making comparisons
      difficult and highlighting the need to develop a gold standard assay.

AB  - Uninsured or underinsured individuals with cancer are likely to experience
      financial hardship, including forgoing healthcare or non-healthcare needs such as
      food, housing, or utilities. This study evaluates the association between health 
      insurance coverage and financial hardship among cancer survivors during the
      COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional analysis used Patient Advocate Foundation
      (PAF) survey data from May to July 2020. Cancer survivors who previously received
      case management or financial aid from PAF self-reported challenges paying for
      healthcare and non-healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Associations
      between insurance coverage and payment challenges were estimated using Poisson
      regression with robust standard errors, which allowed for estimation of adjusted 
      relative risks (aRR). Of 1,437 respondents, 74% had annual household incomes
      <$48,000. Most respondents were enrolled in Medicare (48%), 22% in
      employer-sponsored insurance, 13% in Medicaid, 6% in an Affordable Care Act (ACA)
      plan, and 3% were uninsured. Approximately 31% of respondents reported trouble
      paying for healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were
      uninsured (aRR 2.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.83-3.64), enrolled in an ACA 
      plan (aRR 1.86, 95% CI 1.28-2.72), employer-sponsored insurance (aRR 1.70, 95% CI
      1.23-2.34), or Medicare (aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09-2.03) had higher risk of trouble
      paying for healthcare compared to Medicaid enrollees. Challenges paying for
      non-healthcare needs were reported by 57% of respondents, with 40% reporting
      trouble paying for food, 31% housing, 28% transportation, and 20% internet. In
      adjusted models, Medicare and employer-sponsored insurance enrollees were less
      likely to have difficulties paying for non-healthcare needs compared to Medicaid 
      beneficiaries. Despite 97% of our cancer survivor sample being insured, 31% and
      57% reported trouble paying for healthcare and non-healthcare needs during the
      COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Greater attention to both medical and
      non-medical financial burden is needed given the economic pressures of the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This study is designed to illuminate the specific role and underlying mechanism
      of collagen type III alpha 1 chain (COL3A1) in triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to examine
      mRNA expression of COL3A1. Western blot analysis was employed to determine
      protein levels of COL3A1, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), Bcl-2, and cleaved
      caspase-3. Immunohistochemistry staining was utilized for assessing protein
      expression of Ki67 and COL3A1 in tissues. The proliferous capacity of cells was
      assessed through CCK-8 assay and 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay. Cell apoptosis 
      and the percentage of CD8(+) T cells were measured using flow cytometry.
      Migration and invasion of TNBC cells were examined via transwell assay. Lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) release was measured via a LDH assay kit. For establishing a 
      xenograft tumor model, MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the flank of mice
      through subcutaneous injection. COL3A1 expression was raised in TNBC tissues and 
      cells, and it was inversely associated with overall survival data of TNBC
      patients. COL3A1 downregulation repressed proliferation, invasion, migration, and
      immune escape of TNBC cells along with tumor growth of xenograft mice. In TNBC
      cells and tumor tissues of mice, protein expression of PD-L1 was reduced by
      COL3A1 knockdown. COL3A1 knockdown-mediated inhibitory effects on cell
      proliferation, migration, invasion, and immune escape were reversed by PD-L1
      upregulation in vitro. Silencing of COL3A1 exerted an antitumor role in TNBC,
      implying its potential as a therapeutic target for TNBC.

TI  - Give and Take: Effects of Genetic Admixture on Mutation Load in Endangered
      Florida Panthers.
LID - esac037 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jhered/esac037 [doi]
AB  - Genetic admixture is a biological event inherent to genetic rescue programs aimed
      at the long-term conservation of endangered wildlife. Although the success of
      such programs can be measured by the increase in genetic diversity and fitness of
      subsequent admixed individuals, predictions supporting admixture costs to fitness
      due to the introduction of novel deleterious alleles are necessary. Here, we
      analyzed nonsynonymous variation from conserved genes to quantify and compare
      levels of mutation load (i.e., proportion of deleterious alleles and genotypes
      carrying these alleles) among endangered Florida panthers and non-endangered
      Texas pumas. Specifically, we used canonical (i.e., non-admixed) Florida
      panthers, Texas pumas, and F1 (canonical Florida x Texas) panthers dating from a 
      genetic rescue program and Everglades National Park panthers with Central
      American ancestry resulting from an earlier admixture event. We found neither
      genetic drift nor selection significantly reduced overall proportions of
      deleterious alleles in the severely bottlenecked canonical Florida panthers.
      Nevertheless, the deleterious alleles identified were distributed into a
      disproportionately high number of homozygous genotypes due to close inbreeding in
      this group. Conversely, admixed Florida panthers (either with Texas or Central
      American ancestry) presented reduced levels of homozygous genotypes carrying
      deleterious alleles but increased levels of heterozygous genotypes carrying these
      variants relative to canonical Florida panthers. Although admixture is likely to 
      alleviate the load of standing deleterious variation present in homozygous
      genotypes, our results suggest introduced novel deleterious alleles (temporarily 
      present in heterozygous state) in genetically rescued populations could
      potentially be expressed in subsequent generations if their effective sizes
      remain small.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the value of computed tomography-guided percutaneous
      lung biopsy (CT-PLB) combined with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) in the
      diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). Methods: A total of 108
      patients who diagnosed with PPLs by chest CT examination were prospectively
      collected and randomly divided into ROSE group (n = 56) and No-ROSE group (n =
      52). Both groups received CT-PLB and pathological examination. The smear
      submitted for ROSE was stained using Diff Quik dye. The accuracy, sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV),
      number of punctures, puncture time and incidence of complications were compared
      between the two groups. Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and
      NPV of the ROSE group were 89.29%, 87.50%, 91.67%, 93.33%, and 84.62%,
      respectively. The number of punctures in the ROSE group was significantly lower
      than that in the No-ROSE group (P < .05). The incidence of pneumothorax and
      hemoptysis in the ROSE group were lower than those in the No-ROSE group, but
      there was no statistical difference between the two groups (P > .05). ROSE has
      good concordance with routine pathological examination in the diagnosis of
      unidentified PPLs (Kappa = 0.786, P < .01). Conclusions: CT-PLB combined with
      ROSE is a safe and effective method for the diagnosis of PPLs.

AB  - High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) testing has become an increasing
      important strategy in primary cervical cancer screening in recent years. It
      warrants the evaluation of molecular-based HPV tests for accuracy and efficacy of
      screening. The performance of Roche Cobas 4800 HPV test was validated and
      compared with Digene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) high-risk HPV DNA test for primary
      screening in a large Chinese screening cohort. Of 6345 women screened, overall
      agreement between Cobas and HC2 was 92.23% (95% CI: 91.57-92.89). The inter-assay
      agreement was correlated with the severity of underlying biology, with an
      increasing concordance found in samples with more severe abnormalities. Most of
      the discordant samples had the test signal strength closer to the test limits of 
      the detection than concordant samples, reflecting a low viral load and infection 
      of a cluster of low-risk HPV in these samples. The Cobas test demonstrated
      significantly higher specificity in identifying CIN2+/CIN3+ cases than HC2 test
      (66.46% vs 43.67% and 65.42% vs 42.86%, p<0.001), with comparable sensitivity in 
      clinical evaluation. Increased specificity of Cobas test would accent women
      having the highest risk of developing CIN2+, with the potential to reduce
      unnecessary colposcopy referral in a screening population.

AB  - A multitude of aging-related factors and systemic conditions can cause lacrimal
      gland (LG) or salivary gland (SG) hypofunction leading to degenerative dry eye
      disease (DED) or dry mouth syndrome, respectively. Currently, there are no
      effective regenerative therapies that can fully reverse such gland hypofunction
      due to the lack of reproducible in vitro aging models or organoids required to
      develop novel treatments for multi-omic profiling. Previously, our research group
      successful developed three-dimensional (3D) bioassembly nanotechnologies towards 
      the generation of functional exocrine gland organoids via magnetic 3D bioprinting
      platforms (M3DB). To meet the needs of our aging Asian societies, a next step was
      taken to design consistent M3DB protocols to engineer LG and SG organoid models
      with aging molecular and pathological features. Herein, a feasible step-by-step
      protocol was provided for producing both LG and SG organoids using M3DB
      platforms. Such protocol provided reproducible outcomes with final organoid
      products resembling LG or SG native parenchymal epithelial tissues. Both acinar
      and ductal epithelial compartments were prominent (21 +/- 4.32% versus 42 +/-
      6.72%, respectively), and could be clearly identified in these organoids.
      Meanwhile, these can be further developed into aging signature models by inducing
      cellular senescence via chemical mutagenesis. The generation of senescence-like
      organoids will be our ultimate milestone aiming towards high throughput
      applications for drug screening and discovery, and for gene therapy
      investigations to reverse aging.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272310 [doi]
AB  - Antibiotics were once used in animal production to improve productivity and
      resistance to pathogenic microbiota. However, due to its negative effects, the
      search for a new class of substances that can replace its efficacy has become one
      of the urgent problems to be solved. Plant essential oils (EOs) as a natural feed
      additive can maintain microbiota homeostasis and improve animal performance.
      However, its specific mechanism of action needs to be further investigated.
      Therefore, we added different doses of essential oil of Zanthoxylum bungeanum
      (EOZB) to the diets of Small Tail Han Sheep hybrid male lambs (STH lambs) to
      evaluate the effect of EOZB on rumen enzyme activity, rumen microbiology, and its
      metabolites in STH lambs. Twenty STH lambs were randomly divided into four groups
      (n = 5/group) and provided with the same diet. The dietary treatments were as
      follows: basal diet (BD) group; BD+EOZB 5 ml/kg group; BD+EOZB 10 ml/kg group;
      BD+EOZB 15 ml/kg group. We found that EOZB 10 ml/kg helped to increase rumen
      pectinase (P<0.05) and lipase (P<0.05) activities. Microbial 16S rRNA gene
      analysis showed that EOZB significantly altered the abundance of rumen microbiota
      (P<0.05). LC/GC-MS metabolomic analysis showed that the addition of EOZB produced
      a total of 1073 differential metabolites, with 58 differential metabolites
      remaining after raising the screening criteria. These differential metabolites
      were mainly enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, choline metabolism in
      cancer, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis, and
      protein digestion and absorption. Correlation analysis showed that some rumen
      microbiota were significantly correlated with differential metabolite and enzyme 
      activities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the survival and complications of neoadjuvant
      chemoradiation (NCRT) versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) for esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature
      search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, Wanfang
      Data, CBM, and VIP databases from inception to November 2021. Meta-analyses were 
      performed using RevMan (version 5.3) and Stata version 15.0. RESULTS: A total of 
      18 studies were included, which involved 3137 patients, The results of the
      metaanalysis showed that the pathological complete remission rate (odds ratio
      [OR] = 5.21, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.85-9.50, p<0.00001) and complete
      tumor resection rate (OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.57-3.41, p<0.0001) in the NCRT group
      were significantly better than those in the NCT group. Our meta-analysis results 
      showed that 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates (1-year overall survival [OS]: OR =
      1.51, 95% CI: 1.11-2.05, p = 0.009; 3-year OS: OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.36-2.21,
      p<0.0001; 5-year OS: OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.30-1.99, p<0.00001) in the NCRT group
      were significantly higher than those in the NCT group. NCRT can lead a
      significant survival benefit compared with NCT and there was no significant
      difference between the two neoadjuvant treatments in terms of postoperative
      complications. CONCLUSION: The use of NCRT in the treatment of patients with ESCC
      patients showed significant advantages in terms of survival and safety relative
      to the use of NCT.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268712 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Available but insufficient evidence shows that changes may occur in the 
      immune system following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study
      aimed at evaluating immunological changes in patients with severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia compared with the
      control group. METHOD: The present study was performed on 95 patients with
      COVID-19 (32 severe and 63 moderate cases) and 22 healthy controls. Relationship 
      between immune cells, disease severity and lung involvement was assessed. Binary 
      logistic regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis.
      RESULTS: A significant decrease was observed in CD20+ cell counts of the
      patients. To differentiate patients from healthy individuals, the cutoff point
      for the CD4+ cell count was 688 /muL, sensitivity 0.96, and specificity 0.84. An 
      increase in CD4+ cells reduces the odds of severe disease (odds ratio = 0.82, P =
      0.047) and death (odds ratio = 0.74, P = 0.029). CD4+ cells play a pivotal role
      in the severity of lung involvement (P = 0.03). In addition to CD4+ cells, Fc
      gamma receptor III (FcgammaRIII) (CD16) also played a significant prognosis (odds
      ratio = 0.55, P = 0.047). In severe cases, C-reactive protein, Blood urea
      nitrogen, and Creatine phosphokinase levels, as well as neutrophil counts, were
      significantly higher than those of moderate ones whereas lymphocyte count in
      severe cases was lower than that of moderate ones. CONCLUSION: The number of
      total T-cells and B-cells in patients with COVID-19 was lower than that of
      controls; however, their NK cells increased. FcgammaRIII and CD4+ cells are of
      great importance due to their association with COVID-19 prognosis.

TI  - Suppression of Resistance to Aminolevulinic Acid-based Photodynamic Therapy in
      Oesophageal Cell Lines by Administration of Iron Chelators in Collagen type I
      Matrices.
PG  - 1-47
LID - 10.1080/09553002.2022.2110310 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE Photodynamic therapy (PDT) utilizes visible light to activate cytotoxic
      effects of photosensitizing drugs. PDT protocols require optimization to overcome
      treatment resistance and to induce beneficial anti-tumor immune response. The aim
      of this study was to examine the possibility to suppress resistance of
      oesophageal cell lines to aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT by administration of iron
      chelators to induce sufficient cell cytotoxicity under pathophysiologically
      relevant conditions, mimicking the advanced stages of cancer.MATERIALS AND
      METHODS Effects of ALA-PDT in combination with iron chelators were compared in
      three oesophageal cell lines in conventional monolayers and in 3D cultures based 
      on collagen type I. Modified colony assay and fluorescence-based live cell
      imaging, respectively were applied. The latter was used also to test capability
      of pre-polarized macrophages to interact with cancer cells subjected to ALA-PDT
      with or without iron chelators.RESULTS Iron chelators were effective in the
      enhancement of ALA-PDT in all cell lines under both culture conditions.
      Fluorescence evaluation of cell viability in 3D cultures indicated contribution
      of apoptotic cell death after ALA-PDT, both with and without iron chelators.
      Engulfment of remnants of dead cancer cells by macrophages in 2D cultures was
      indicated, however, interaction between macrophages and cancer cells in 3D
      cultures subjected to ALA-PDT with or without iron chelators was not
      present.CONCLUSIONS Potential of iron chelators to enhance ALA-PDT was maintained
      in 3D collagen matrices. Although PDT dose (ALA concentration, light exposure
      time) required modification in cell line dependent manner to achieve comparable
      effect of PDT alone in conventional monolayers and in collagen matrices, the
      potential of iron chelators to suppress resistance of oesophageal cells to
      ALA-PDT was not influenced by fibrillar collagen matrix.

TI  - Imaging Features of Premalignant Biliary Lesions and Predisposing Conditions with
      Pathologic Correlation.
PG  - 210194
LID - 10.1148/rg.210194 [doi]
AB  - Biliary malignancies include those arising from the intrahepatic and extrahepatic
      bile ducts as well as the gallbladder and hepatopancreatic ampulla of Vater. The 
      majority of intrahepatic and extrahepatic malignancies are cholangiocarcinomas
      (CCAs). They arise owing to a complex interplay between the patient-specific
      genetic background and multiple risk factors and may occur in the liver
      (intrahepatic CCA), hilum (perihilar CCA), or extrahepatic bile ducts (distal
      CCA). Biliary-type adenocarcinoma constitutes the most common histologic type of 
      ampullary and gallbladder malignancies. Its prognosis is poor and surgical
      resection is considered curative, so early detection is key, with multimodality
      imaging playing a central role in making the diagnosis. There are several risk
      factors for biliary malignancy as well as predisposing conditions that increase
      the risk; this review highlights the pertinent imaging features of these entities
      with histopathologic correlation. The predisposing factors are broken down into
      three major categories: (a) congenital malformations such as choledochal cyst and
      pancreaticobiliary maljunction; (b) infectious or inflammatory conditions such as
      parasitic infections, hepatolithiasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and
      porcelain gallbladder; and (c) preinvasive epithelial neoplasms such as biliary
      intraepithelial neoplasm, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct,
      intra-ampullary papillary tubular neoplasm, and intracholecystic papillary
      neoplasm of the gallbladder. Recognizing the baseline features of these
      premalignant biliary entities and changes in their appearance over time that
      indicate the advent of malignancy in high-risk patients can lead to early
      diagnosis and potentially curative management. An invited commentary by
      Volpacchio is available online. Online supplemental material is available for
      this article. ((c))RSNA, 2022.

TI  - Sequelae of Eating Disorders at Imaging.
PG  - 220018
LID - 10.1148/rg.220018 [doi]
AB  - Although eating disorders are common, they tend to be underdiagnosed and
      undertreated because social stigma tends to make patients less likely to seek
      medical attention and less compliant with medical treatment. Diagnosis is crucial
      because these disorders can affect any organ system and are associated with the
      highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Because of this, imaging
      findings, when recognized, can be vital to the diagnosis and management of eating
      disorders and their related complications. The authors familiarize the
      radiologist with the pathophysiology and sequelae of eating disorders and provide
      an overview of the related imaging findings. Some imaging findings associated
      with eating disorders are nonspecific, and others are subtle. The presence of
      these findings should alert the radiologist to correlate them with the patient's 
      medical history and laboratory results and the clinical team's findings at the
      physical examination. The combination of these findings may suggest a diagnosis
      that might otherwise be missed. Topics addressed include (a) the pathophysiology 
      of eating disorders, (b) the clinical presentation of patients with eating
      disorders and their medical complications and sequelae, (c) the imaging features 
      associated with common and uncommon sequelae of eating disorders, (d) an overview
      of management and treatment of eating disorders, and (e) conditions that can
      mimic eating disorders (eg, substance abuse, medically induced eating disorders, 
      and malnourishment in patients with cancer). Online supplemental material is
      available for this article. ((c))RSNA, 2022.

      "Radiation and Circulatory Effects".
PG  - 1-21
LID - 10.1080/09553002.2022.2110304 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This article summarizes a number of presentations from a session on
      "Radiation and Circulatory Effects" held during the Radiation Research Society
      Online 67(th) Annual Meeting, October 3 - 6 2021. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      Different epidemiological cohorts were analyzed with various statistical means
      common in epidemiology. The cohorts included the one from the U.S. Million Person
      Study and the Canadian Fluoroscopy Cohort Study. In addition, one of the
      contributions in our article relies on results from analyses of the Japanese
      atomic bomb survivors, Russian emergency and recovery workers and cohorts of
      nuclear workers. The Canadian Fluoroscopy Cohort Study data were analyzed with a 
      larger series of linear and nonlinear dose-response models in addition to the
      linear no-threshold (LNT) model.Results and Conclusions: The talks in this
      symposium showed that low/moderate acute doses at low/moderate dose-rates can be 
      associated with an increased risk of CVD, although some of the epidemiological
      results for occupational cohorts are equivocal. The usually only limited
      availability of information on well-known risk factors for circulatory disease
      (e.g. smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, physical activity) is an
      important limiting factor that may bias any observed association between
      radiation exposure and detrimental health outcome especially at low doses.
      Additional follow-up and careful dosimetric and outcome assessment are necessary 
      and more epidemiological and experimental research is required. Obtaining
      reliable information on other risk factors is especially important.

TI  - Suspected Interstitial Lung Disease in COPDGene.
LID - 10.1164/rccm.202203-0550OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: While interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), specific patterns of
      incidentally-detected abnormal density on computed tomography (CT), have been
      associated with abnormal lung function and increased mortality, it is unclear if 
      a subset with incidental interstitial lung disease (ILD) accounts for these
      adverse consequences. OBJECTIVES: To define the prevalence and risk factors of
      suspected ILD and assess outcomes. METHODS: Suspected ILD was evaluated in the
      COPDGene cohort, defined as ILA and at least one additional criterion: definite
      fibrosis on CT, FVC less than 80% predicted, or DLCO less than 70% predicted.
      Multivariable linear, longitudinal, and Cox proportional hazards regression
      models were used to assess associations with St. George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ), Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), supplemental oxygen use,
      respiratory exacerbations, and mortality. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 4361 
      participants with available data, 239 (5%) had evidence for suspected ILD while
      204 (5%) had ILA without suspected ILD. In multivariable analyses, suspected ILD 
      was associated with increased SGRQ score (mean difference [MD] 3.8points; 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 0.6-7.1; P=0.02), reduced 6MWT (MD -35m; 95%CI
      -56m,-13m; P=0.002), greater supplemental oxygen use (odds ratio [OR] 2.3; 95%CI 
      1.1-5.1; P=0.03) and severe respiratory exacerbations (OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.1-7.5;
      P=0.03), and higher mortality (hazard ratio 2.4; 95%CI 1.2-4.6; P=0.01) compared 
      to ILA without suspected ILD. Risk factors associated with suspected ILD included
      self-identified black race (OR 2.0; 95%CI 1.1-3.3; P=0.01) and pack-years smoking
      history (OR 1.2; 95%CI 1.1-1.3; P=0.0005). CONCLUSION: Suspected ILD is present
      in half of those with ILA in COPDGene and is associated with exercise decrements 
      and increased symptoms, supplemental oxygen use, severe respiratory
      exacerbations, and mortality.

TI  - Trends in hospitalization and death rates among patients with head and neck
      cancer in Spain, 2009 to 2019.
PG  - 2082192
LID - 10.1080/21645515.2022.2082192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most
      common cancer worldwide, and prevalence is still substantially higher in men than
      in women. Causative factors include smoking and alcohol use, while human
      papillomavirus (HPV) infection is causally related to a subset of oropharyngeal
      cancers. In this retrospective study, we aimed to provide estimates on the
      clinical and economic burden of HNSCC in Spain. METHODS: We used the discharge
      reports from the Spanish Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS), to retrospectively
      analyze hospital discharge data in individuals with a diagnosis of HNSCC in any
      diagnostic position, based on the ICD coding system (ICD-9-CM and ICD10 CM), from
      2009 to 2019. RESULTS: A total of 175,340 admissions and 14,498 deaths due to
      laryngeal, pharyngeal and oral cavity cancer were recorded in Spain, of which 85%
      occurred in men. The most prevalent diagnoses were laryngeal cancer in men
      (50.9%) and oral cavity cancer in women (49.1%). In general, the hospitalization 
      and death rates for all major head and neck cancer sites decreased in men and
      increased or remained stable in women during the study period. However, the
      corresponding rates for tonsil cancer, strongly associated with HPV infection,
      increased significantly in men. Overall, the economic burden of HNSCC during the 
      study period was estimated at 100 million euros per year on average. CONCLUSION: 
      HNSCC still places an important clinical and economic burden on the health system
      in Spain. Prevention strategies should be prioritized, and vaccination programs
      against HPV in both sexes should be reinforced.

TI  - Emerging mitochondrial signaling mechanisms in cardio-oncology: beyond oxidative 
      stress.
LID - 10.1152/ajpheart.00231.2022 [doi]
AB  - Many anti-cancer therapies (CTx) have cardiotoxic side effects that limit their
      therapeutic potential and cause long-term cardiovascular complications in cancer 
      survivors. This has given rise to the field of cardio-oncology, which recognizes 
      the need for basic, translational, and clinical research focused on understanding
      the complex signaling events that drive CTx-induced cardiovascular toxicity.
      Several CTx agents cause mitochondrial damage in the form of mitochondrial DNA
      deletions, mutations, and suppression of respiratory function and ATP production.
      In this review, we provide a brief overview of the cardiovascular complications
      of clinically used CTx agents and discuss current knowledge of local and systemic
      secondary signaling events that arise in response to mitochondrial stress/damage.
      Mitochondrial oxidative stress has long been recognized as a contributor to
      CTx-induced cardiotoxicity; thus, we focus on emerging roles for mitochondria in 
      epigenetic regulation, innate immunity, and signaling via non-coding RNAs and
      mitochondrial hormones. Because data exploring mitochondrial secondary signaling 
      in the context of cardio-oncology are limited, we also draw upon clinical and
      pre-clinical studies which have examined these pathways in other relevant
      pathologies.

TI  - State-of-the-art of ultrasound-triggered drug delivery from ultrasound-responsive
      drug carriers.
LID - 10.1080/17425247.2022.2110585 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The development of new tools to locally and non-invasively
      transferring therapeutic substances at the desired site in deep living tissue has
      been a long sought-after goal within the drug delivery field. Among the
      established methods, ultrasound (US) with US-responsive carriers holds great
      promise and demonstrates on-demand delivery of a variety of functional substances
      with spatial precision of several millimeters in deep-seated tissues in animal
      models and humans. These properties have motivated several explorations of US
      with US responsive carriers as a modality for neuromodulation and the treatment
      of various diseases, such as stroke and cancer. AREAS COVERED: This article
      briefly discussed three specific mechanisms that enhance in vivo drug delivery
      via US with US-responsive carriers: 1) permeabilizing cellular membrane, 2)
      increasing the permeability of vessels, and 3) promoting cellular endocytotic
      uptake. Besides, a series of US-responsive drug carriers are discussed, with an
      emphasis on the relation between structural feature and therapeutic outcome.
      EXPERT OPINION: This article summarized current development for each of
      US-responsive drug carrier, focusing on the routes of enhancing delivery and
      applications. The mechanisms of interaction between US-responsive carriers and US
      energy, such as cavitation, hyperthermia, and reactive oxygen species, as well as
      how these interactions can improve drug delivery into target cell/tissue. It can 
      be expected that there are serval efforts to further identification of
      US-responsive particles, design of novel US waveform sequence, and survey of
      optimal combination between US parameters and US-responsive carriers for better
      controlling the spatiotemporal drug release profile, stability, and safety in
      vivo. The authors believe these will provide novel tools for precisely designing 
      treatment strategies and significantly benefit the clinical management of several
      diseases.

TI  - The therapeutic relevance of the Kallikrein-Kinin axis in SARS-cov-2-induced
      vascular pathology.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/10408363.2022.2102578 [doi]
AB  - While coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) begins as a respiratory infection, it
      progresses as a systemic disease involving multiorgan microthromboses that
      underly the pathology. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells via attachment to the
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed in a
      multitude of tissues, including the lung (alveolar cells), heart, intestine,
      kidney, testis, gallbladder, vasculature (endothelial cells), and immune cells.
      Interference in ACE2 signaling could drive the aforementioned systemic
      pathologies, such as endothelial dysfunction, microthromboses, and systemic
      inflammation, that are typically seen in patients with severe COVID-19. ACE2 is a
      component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is intimately associated with
      the plasma kallikrein-kinin system (KKS). As many papers are published on the
      role of ACE and ACE2 in COVID-19, we will review the role of bradykinin, and more
      broadly the KSS, in SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, we will
      discuss the possible therapeutic interventions that are approved and in
      development for the following targets: coagulation factor XII (FXII), tissue
      kallikrein (KLK1), plasma kallikrein (KLKB1), bradykinin (BK), plasminogen
      activator inhibitor (PAI-1), bradykinin B1 receptor (BKB1R), bradykinin B2
      receptor (BKB2R), ACE, furin, and the NLRP3 inflammasome. Understanding these
      targets may prove of value in the treatment of COVID-19 as well as in other
      virus-induced coagulopathies in the future.

TI  - Prevaccine Human Papillomavirus Status in Invasive and Intraepithelial Lesions of
      the Vulva in New Zealand Women.
LID - 10.1097/LGT.0000000000000687 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, introduced in New Zealand (NZ)
      in 2008, is predicted to substantially lower the incidence of HPV-associated
      precancers and cancers. The aim of this study is to estimate the proportion of
      vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) lesions and invasive vulvar squamous cell 
      carcinomas (SCCV) attributable to HPV in NZ women treated by the Auckland
      Regional Gynecological Oncology Service, covering an estimated 50% of the NZ
      population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction and reverse
      hybridization were used to analyze retrospective histologically proven SCCV from 
      1990 to 2007 and VIN lesions from 2000 to 2007 for HPV content and genotype in a 
      collaborative study with the Catalan Institute of Oncology. Immunohistochemistry 
      for p16INK4a was performed on SCCV, which were attributed to HPV if both tested
      positive. RESULTS: Polymerase chain reaction testing for HPV content and genotype
      was performed on 66 VIN lesions (all high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions)
      and 189 SCCV. In addition, p16 immunohistochemistry was performed on 168 of the
      189 SCCV (88.9%) tested for HPV-DNA. Overall, 61 SCCV cases (36.3%) were
      attributed to HPV (HPV+/p16+), and 89 SCCV cases (53%) were considered to have
      developed independently of HPV (HPV-/p16-). Known high-risk HPV genotypes were
      present in 96.8% of HPV-DNA-positive vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial
      lesions and 98.4% of HPV-attributable SCCV. Human papillomavirus 16 represented
      the most common genotype in both. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the HPV vaccine is likely
      to substantially alter the profile of SCCV in our region. The results provide a
      baseline assessment of the HPV status of vulvar neoplasia before the introduction
      of the HPV vaccine.

TI  - Cancer Survivors' Perspectives of Virtual Yoga for Chronic Chemotherapy-Induced
      Peripheral Neuropathy Pain During the COVID-19 Pandemic.
LID - 10.1097/CIN.0000000000000937 [doi]
AB  - With the rise in telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic, further research is
      needed to determine how to optimize virtual delivery of existing integrative
      oncology interventions for cancer treatment-related symptoms. The purpose of this
      qualitative analysis was to explore cancer survivors' perspectives of the
      acceptability and satisfaction of an 8-week, virtual yoga intervention for cancer
      survivors with chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain. Fourteen 
      participants with chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain who
      completed the virtual yoga intervention were interviewed using a semistructured
      interview guide. Themes were derived from the data using inductive content
      analysis methods. Main findings from the interviews included the following: (1)
      participants were willing to try new nonpharmacological treatments for
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy due to the high symptom burden and
      prior lack of success with medications; (2) participants highly rated the
      flexibility offered by the virtual format, but desired the social support
      potentially offered by practicing in-person yoga; and (3) the impact of virtual
      yoga on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy severity was unclear. There
      were several barriers to participants' use of virtual yoga for chronic
      chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy pain (eg, technology, lack of
      space/equipment). The results may be used to improve the design and delivery of
      future trials testing virtual yoga for chronic chemotherapy-induced peripheral
      neuropathy pain.

TI  - Serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 as a potential biomarker for
      diagnosis and prognosis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3) has been
      reported to be related to the risk of some cancers. Here we focussed on serum
      IGFBP3 as a possible biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis for oesophageal
      squamous carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
      used to measure the serum IGFBP3 level in the training cohort including 136 ESCC 
      patients and 119 normal controls and the validation cohort with 55 ESCC patients 
      and 42 normal controls. The receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) was
      used to assess the diagnosis value. Cox proportional hazards model was applied to
      select factors for survival nomogram construction. RESULTS: Serum IGFBP3 levels
      were significantly lower in early-stage ESCC or ESCC patients than those in
      normal controls (p < .05). The specificity and sensitivity of serum IGFBP3 for
      the diagnosis of ESCC were 95.80% and 50.00%, respectively, with the area under
      the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.788 in the training cohort. Similar results were
      observed in the validation cohort (88.10%, 38.18%, and 0.710). Importantly, serum
      IGFBP3 could also differentiate early-stage ESCC from controls (95.80%, 52.54%,
      0.777 and 88.10%, 36.36%, 0.695 in training and validation cohorts,
      respectively). Furthermore, Cox multivariate analysis revealed that serum IGFBP3 
      was an independent prognostic risk factor (HR = 2.599, p = .002). Lower serum
      IGFBP3 level was correlated with reduced overall survival (p < .05). Nomogram
      based on serum IGFBP3, TNM stage, and tumour size improved the prognostic
      prediction of ESCC with a concordance index of 0.715. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated
      that serum IGFBP3 was a potential biomarker of diagnosis and prognosis for ESCC. 
      Meanwhile, the nomogram might help predict the prognosis of ESCC. Key
      MessageSerum IGFBP3 showed early diagnostic value in oesophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma with independent cohort validation. Moreover, serum IGFBP3 was
      identified as an independent prognostic risk factor, which was used to construct 
      a nomogram with improved prognosis ability in oesophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family caregivers of cancer patients are very involved in
      communication with healthcare teams; however, little is known about their
      experiences. Limited information is known about how the type of cancer patients
      have impact caregiving experiences. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to compare the
      caregiving experience of caregivers of hospice lung cancer patients with hospice 
      caregivers of patients with all other cancer types. METHOD: This study is based
      on a secondary analysis of data generated from a parent study evaluating a
      behavioral intervention with caregivers of hospice cancer patients. RESULTS: When
      comparing caregiving experiences by patient diagnosis, significant differences
      were found in caregivers of hospice lung cancer demographics and experiences with
      caregiver-centered communication. Specifically, caregivers of lung cancer
      patients have significantly more trouble with exchange of information, fostering 
      relationships, and decision making with their hospice team. CONCLUSION: More
      research is needed to understand the impact of lung cancer on caregiver centered 
      communication and the necessary interventions required to address these issues.

TI  - An Evaluation of Gene-Diet Interaction Statistical Methods and Discovery of
      rs7175421-Whole Grain Interaction in Lung Cancer.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2022.2104878 [doi]
AB  - Dietary factors show different effects on genetically diverse populations.
      Scientific research uses gene-environment interaction models to study the effects
      of dietary factors on genetically diverse populations for lung cancer risk.
      However, previous study designs have not investigated the degree of type I error 
      inflation and, in some instances, have not corrected for multiple testing. Using 
      a motivating investigation of diet-gene interaction and lung cancer risk, we
      propose a training and testing strategy and perform real-world simulations to
      select the appropriate statistical methods to reduce false-positive discoveries. 
      The simulation results show that the unconstrained maximum likelihood (UML)
      method controls the type I error better than the constrained maximum likelihood
      (CML). The empirical Bayesian (EB) method can compete with the UML method in
      achieving statistical power and controlling type I error. We observed a
      significant interaction between SNP rs7175421 with dietary whole grain in lung
      cancer prevention, with an effect size (standard error) of -0.312 (0.112) for EB 
      estimate. SNP rs7175421 may interact with dietary whole grains in modulating lung
      cancer risk. Evaluating statistical methods for gene-diet interaction analysis
      can help balance the statistical power and type I error.

TI  - Sustained delivery of gemcitabine via in situ injectable mussel-inspired
      hydrogels for the local therapy of pancreatic cancer.
LID - 10.1039/d1tb02858h [doi]
AB  - The issue of pervasively enhanced drug resistance of pancreatic cancer is
      fundamental to a better understanding of gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
      Currently available treatment plans involving injectable therapeutics are mainly 
      engineered to improve the performance and broaden their applications in the
      domain of biomedicine. Fixed-dose-rate infusion of free gemcitabine (Gem) has
      drawn appropriate attention for its potent anti-tumor efficacy against various
      solid tumors, whereas it remains a considerable challenge to extend its
      application and achieve better treatment. Here, we have prepared and demonstrated
      a long-acting delivery system using gemcitabine and injectable in situ hydrogel
      for the localized treatment of pancreatic cancer. The hydrogel was prepared using
      polysaccharide derivatives, oxidized-carboxymethylcellulose (OCMC) and
      carboxymethylchitosan (CMCS) at optimal ratios by a dopamine-functionalized
      method for the controlled release of Gem. In vitro drug release behaviors for up 
      to a week indicated sustained drug release of the Gem delivery system. Moreover, 
      desirable apoptosis promotion and apparent cellular proliferation inhibition
      associated with the drug depot have been found in vitro against BxPC-3 pancreatic
      cancer cells, bringing minimized side effects to systemic normal tissues. The
      current findings manifested that the release out of the localized delivery
      platform in a sustained pattern afforded a durable gemcitabine-based chemotherapy
      effect and inhibited tumor metastasis more persistently after intratumoral
      injection of the Gem@Gel system, thereby advancing the development of novel
      drug-loaded materials with properties not accessed previously.

TI  - The Variations in Care and Real-world Outcomes in Individuals With Rectal Cancer:
      Protocol for the Ontario Rectal Cancer Cohort.
PG  - e38874
LID - 10.2196/38874 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with rectal cancer require a number of pretreatment
      investigations, often require multidisciplinary treatment, and require ongoing
      follow-ups after treatment is completed. Due to the complexity of treatments,
      large variations in practice patterns and outcomes have been identified. At
      present, few comprehensive, population-level data sets are available for
      assessing interventions and outcomes in this group. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to 
      create a comprehensive database of individuals with rectal cancer who have been
      treated in a single-payer, universal health care system. This database will
      provide an excellent resource that investigators can use to study variations in
      the delivery of care to and real-world outcomes of this population. METHODS: The 
      Ontario Rectal Cancer Cohort database will include comprehensive details about
      the management and outcomes of individuals with rectal cancer who have been
      diagnosed in Ontario, Canada (population: 14.6 million), between 2010 and 2019.
      Linked administrative data sets will be used to construct this comprehensive
      database. Individual and care provider characteristics, investigations,
      treatments, follow-ups, and outcomes will be derived and linked. Surgical
      pathology details, including the stage of disease, histopathology
      characteristics, and the quality of surgical excision, will be included. Ethics
      approval for this study was obtained through the Queen's University Health
      Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board. RESULTS:
      Approximately 20,000 individuals who meet the inclusion criteria for this study
      have been identified. Data analysis is ongoing, with an expected completion date 
      of March 2023. This study was funded through the Canadian Institute of Health
      Research Operating Grant. CONCLUSIONS: The Ontario Rectal Cancer Cohort will
      include a comprehensive data set of individuals with rectal cancer who received
      care within a single-payer, universal health care system. This cohort will be
      used to determine factors associated with regional variability and adherence to
      recommended care, and it will allow for an assessment of a number of understudied
      areas within the delivery of rectal cancer treatment. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED

TI  - An Enhancer Variant Associated with Breast Cancer Susceptibility in Black Women
      Regulates TNFSF10 Expression and Antitumor Immunity in Triple-Negative Breast
      Cancer.

LID - 10.1093/hmg/ddac168 [doi]
AB  - Women of African ancestry have the highest mortality from triple-negative breast 
      cancer (TNBC) of all racial groups. To understand the genomic basis of breast
      cancer in the populations, we previously conducted genome-wide association
      studies (GWAS) and identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated
      with breast cancer in Black women. In this study, we investigated the functional 
      significance of the top associated SNP rs13074711. We found the SNP served as an 
      enhancer variant and regulated TNFSF10 (TRAIL) expression in TNBC cells, with a
      significant association between the SNP genotype and TNFSF10 expression in breast
      tumors. Mechanistically, rs13074711 modulated the binding activity of c-MYB at
      the motif and thereby controlled TNFSF10 expression. Interestingly, TNFSF10
      expression in many cancers was consistently lower in African Americans (AA)
      compared to European Americans (EA). Furthermore, TNFSF10 expression in TNBC was 
      significantly correlated with expression of antiviral immune genes and was
      regulated by type I interferons (IFNs). Accordingly, loss of TNFSF10 resulted in 
      a profound decrease in apoptosis of TNBC cells in response to type I IFNs and
      poly (I:C), a synthetic analogue of double stranded virus. Lastly, in a syngeneic
      mouse model of breast cancer, TNFSF10-deficiency in breast tumors decreased
      tumor-infiltrated CD4+ and CD8+ T cell quantities. Collectively, our results
      suggested that TNFSF10 plays an important role in the regulation of antiviral
      immune responses in TNBC, and the expression is in part regulated by a genetic
      variant associated with breast cancer in Black women. Our results underscore the 
      important contributions of genetic variants to immune defense mechanisms.

AB  - PURPOSE: To better understand the current salaries and student loan debt levels
      among oncology social workers (OSWs). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using online 
      survey. SAMPLE: OSWs across a variety of cancer care settings in the U.S. (n =
      1055). METHODS: Salary and debt were collected via single ordinal variables.
      Crosstabs and chi-square tests were used to examine whether salary and debt
      differ by demographic and work-related characteristics. FINDINGS: Median OSW
      salaries ranged from $60,001 to $70,000. Three-fourths of OSWs reported having
      student loan debt. Younger and recently graduated OSWs and OSWs of color were
      more likely to have greater student loan debt than their counterparts.
      CONCLUSIONS: Relative low salary and debt burden have important implications for 
      securing a current and future OSW workforce. IMPLICATIONS FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL
      POLICY: Adequate reimbursement and loan repayment opportunities for frontline
      OSWs will better secure this workforce. Advocacy efforts to identify OSWs
      qualified for loan forgiveness programs are warranted.

PG  - 1-18
LID - 10.1080/13816810.2022.2106497 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma (RB) is initiated by mutation in both alleles of RB1
      gene. However, few cases may occur even in the absence of RB1 mutation suggesting
      the role of genes other than RB1. METHODOLOGY: The current study was planned to
      utilize targeted exome sequencing in Indian RB patients affected with unilateral 
      non-familial RB. 75 unilateral RB patients below 5 years of age were enrolled.
      Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and tumor tissue. From peripheral blood DNA,
      all coding and exon/intron regions were amplified using PCR and direct
      sequencing. Cases which did not harbor pathogenic variants in peripheral blood
      DNA were further screened for mutations in their tumor tissue DNA using targeted 
      exome sequencing. Three pathogenicity prediction tools (Mutation Taster, SIFT,
      and PolyPhen-2) were used to determine the pathogenicity of non-synonymous
      variations. An in-house bioinformatics pipeline was devised for the mutation
      screening by targeted exome sequencing. Protein modeling studies were also done
      to predict the effect of the mutations on the protein structure and function.
      RESULTS: Using the mentioned approach, we found two novel variants
      (g.69673_69674insT and g.48373314C>A) in RB1 gene in peripheral blood DNA. We
      also found novel variants in eight genes (RB1, ACAD11, GPR151, KCNA1, OTOR,
      SOX30, ARL11, and MYCT1) that may be associated with RB pathogenesis. CONCLUSION:
      The present study expands our current knowledge regarding the genomic landscape
      of RB and also highlights the importance of NGS technologies to detect genes and 
      novel variants that may play an important role in cancer initiation, progression,
      and prognosis.

TI  - Versatile Electrochemical Biosensor Based on the Target-Controlled Capture and
      Release of DNA Nanotubes for the Ultrasensitive Detection of Multiplexed
      Biomarkers.
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02541 [doi]
AB  - Herein, an ultrasensitive and versatile electrochemical biosensor was developed
      through the target-controlled capture and release of signal probe-loaded DNA
      nanotube for the ultrasensitive detection of two different types of
      cancer-related biomarkers, microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) and glutathione (GSH). In this 
      system, target 1 (miRNA-21) first triggered duplex-specific nuclease
      (DSN)-assisted recycle amplification to generate numerous disulfide-linked DNA
      strands (DL), which could effectively capture DNA nanotube to immobilize
      methylene blue (MB) to produce remarkable electrochemical signals and achieve the
      ultrasensitive detection of miRNA-21 with a detection limit down to 32.6 aM.
      Furthermore, in the presence of target 2 (GSH), the electrochemical signal was
      significantly reduced by a thiol-disulfide bond exchange reaction on DL to
      release MB-immobilized DNA nanotubes away from the sensing interface, which
      enabled the sensitive analysis of GSH with a detection limit of 0.379 nM.
      Impressively, this strategy could achieve ultrasensitive detection of different
      types of biomarkers to prominently lessen false-positive responses from the
      current sensing methods toward a single biomarker or the same type of biomarker
      and remarkably heighten the accuracy and precision of early cancer diagnosis.
      Meanwhile, the proposed electrochemical biosensor made it possible to realize the
      regenerative analysis of targets over four times without extra fuel, which could 
      conspicuously improve the analytical efficiency compared with that of traditional
      biosensing assays. As a result, this study might open up novel insights to design
      a versatile and multifunctional sensing platform and encourage deeper exploration
      for detecting different types of biomarkers in the fields of early disease
      diagnosis and biochemical research.

AB  - Fucoidans are promising sulfated polysaccharides isolated from marine sources
      that have piqued the interest of scientists in recent years due to their
      widespread use as a bioactive substance. Bioactive coatings and films,
      unsurprisingly, have seized these substances to create novel, culinary,
      therapeutic, and diagnostic bioactive nanomaterials. The applications of fucoidan
      and its composite nanomaterials have a wide variety of food as well as
      pharmacological properties, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory,
      anti-cancer, anti-thrombic, anti-coagulant, immunoregulatory, and anti-viral
      properties. Blends of fucoidan with other biopolymers such as chitosan, alginate,
      curdlan, starch, etc., have shown promising coating and film-forming
      capabilities. A blending of biopolymers is a recommended approach to improve
      their anticipated properties. This review focuses on the fundamental knowledge
      and current development of fucoidan, fucoidan-based composite material for
      bioactive coatings and films, and their biological properties. In this article,
      fucoidan-based edible bioactive coatings and films expressed excellent mechanical
      strength that can prolong the shelf-life of food products and maintain their
      biodegradability. Additionally, these coatings and films showed numerous
      applications in the biomedical field and contribute to the economy. We hope this 
      review can deliver the theoretical basis for the development of fucoidan-based
      bioactive material and films.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic chemotherapy is the primary treatment in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). More
      effective treatment options are highly awaited. The aim of this study was to
      evaluate the toxicity and feasibility of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel/S-1 (GAS)
      chemotherapy on a 21-day cycle in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
      PDAC, determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of S-1 in this regimen, and explore preliminary efficacy. METHODS: Eligible
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC received GAS chemotherapy on a 
      21-day cycle. Fixed-dose nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) 
      were given intravenously on days 1 and 8. Different doses of S-1 were given
      orally twice daily from day 1 to day 14 in a 3+3 dose escalation design.
      According to patients` body surface area, the dose-escalation design was as
      follows: patients with a body surface area of 1.25-1.5 m2 received S-1 40 mg/day 
      initially and the dose was increased to 60 mg or 80 mg. Patients with a body
      surface area of more than 1.5 m2 received S-1 60 mg/day initially and the dose
      was increased to 80 mg or 100 mg. The primary endpoints were to evaluate the
      toxicity and determine the DLT and MTD of S-1. The secondary endpoint was to
      evaluate efficacy, including best objective response rate (ORR), disease control 
      rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). adverse
      events (AEs) were evaluated according to the NCI-CTCAE 5.0. Tumor response was
      assessed using the RECIST 1.1. RESULTS: A total of 21 eligible patients were
      included. Due to the infrequence of patients with a body surface area of 1.25-1.5
      m2, only 2 patients were included in cohort of S-1 40 mg. The dose-escalation for
      patients in this group failed to be enrolled completely. For patients with a body
      surface area of more than 1.5 m2, 3 DLTs in 7 patients were detected at cohort of
      S-1 100 mg (grade 3 thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage, grade 3 rash, and grade 3
      mucositis/stomatitis). S-1 80 mg/day (body surface area: >1.5 m2) was considered 
      to be the MTD in GAS chemotherapy on a 21-day cycle. No grade 4 AEs or
      treatment-related deaths were observed. The most commonly occurring hematologic
      AE of any grade was anemia (38.1%). The most frequent nonhematologic AEs of any
      grade were peripheral neuropathy (38.1%), dyspepsia (23.8%), constipation
      (23.8%), and alopecia (23.8%). Response assessment showed that the best ORR was
      36.8% (7 of 19 patients) and the DCR was 94.7% (18 of 19 patients). The median
      PFS was 5.3 (95% CI, 4.6 to 6.0) months and the median OS was 10.3 (95% CI, 8.1
      to 12.5) months. CONCLUSION: GAS chemotherapy (21-day cycle) with nab-paclitaxel 
      125 mg/m2, gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2, and S-1 80 mg/day (body surface area: >1.5 m2)
      was found to have acceptable toxicity and significant clinical control in
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic PDAC. We conclude that further
      trials with this combination are warranted. (Trial Identifier: ChiCTR1900027833

TI  - Oncologic outcomes of salvage surgery and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in 
      recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A single-institution
      retrospective study.
LID - 10.1002/hed.27162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival outcomes in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
      (HNSCC) are poor. This study aimed to compare survival outcomes between salvage
      surgery and immunotherapy in patients with recurrent advanced HNSCC. METHODS:
      Patients with advanced stage (stage III or IV) recurrent HNSCC following
      treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy were included. Survival was estimated 
      using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression was used for multivariate
      logistic regression. RESULTS: Two-year overall survival after salvage surgery was
      68.6% and after immunotherapy patients was 24.6%. Multivariate logistic
      regression showed that salvage surgery was associated with improved survival
      without statistical significance (hazard ratio [HR] 0.12, p = 0.25). Subgroup
      analysis of patients with oral cavity/oropharyngeal cancer noted improved
      survival with salvage surgery over immunotherapy (HR 0.006, p = 0.01) and
      decreased survival with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 5 (HR 6.4, p =
      0.02). CONCLUSION: Our retrospective single-institutional data suggest that
      resectable advanced stage recurrent HNSCC may have improved survival with salvage
      surgery in appropriately selected patients, but larger prospective studies are
      required.

      glowworm swarm optimization (FCMGSO) method.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.1080/07391102.2022.2105958 [doi]
AB  - Assessment of DNA and ligand interaction is a great challenge to the medical
      researchers and drug industries since the accurate mapping of DNA and ligand
      plays an important role in associating drugs for suitable diseases. The primary
      objective of this research work is to develop an efficient model for predicting
      the best DNA and Ligand mapping. In this research work, 500 instances of DNA and 
      drugs used for cancer and non-cancer diseases from the National Centre for
      Biotechnology Information (NCBI) were considered for analysis. Binding energy is 
      one of the important measures to predict and finalize the best DNA and ligand
      interaction. Existing methods used for the docking process such as Simulated
      Annealing (SA), Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm (LGA), Genetic Clustering (GC),
      Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM), and Genetic Clustering with Multi swarm
      Optimization (GCMSO) were applied for all 500 instances. These algorithms failed 
      to produce better binding energy due to a lack of optimization in the existing
      approaches. Optimization methods play a major role in predicting accurate DNA
      ligand docking. Hence, this research proposes an efficient architecture using
      Fuzzy C-Means Clustering with Glowworm Swarm (FCMGSO) optimization method for
      accurate analysis of the DNA-ligand docking process. Results are proving that the
      proposed FCMGSO algorithm shows less binding energy than other existing methods
      in all instances of samples considered from the NCBI dataset.Communicated by

TI  - MiRNA biomarkers in cancers of the male reproductive system: are we approaching
      clinical application?
LID - 10.1111/andr.13258 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Specific cancer types face specific clinical management challenges.
      Owing to their stability, robustness and fast, easy, and cost-effective
      detection, microRNAs (miRNAs) are attractive candidate biomarkers to the clinic. 
      OBJECTIVES: Based on a comprehensive review of the relevant literature in the
      field, we explore the potential of miRNAs as biomarkers to answer relevant
      clinical dilemmas inherent to cancers of the male reproductive tract (prostate
      (PCa), testis (TGCTs) and penis (PeCa)) and identify some of the
      challenges/limitations hampering their widely application. RESULTS AND
      DISCUSSION: We conclude that the use of miRNAs as biomarkers is at different
      stages for these distinct cancer types. While for TGCTs, miRNA-371a-3p is
      universally accepted to fill in important clinicals gaps and is moving fast
      towards clinical implementation, for PCa almost no overlap of miRNAs exists
      between studies, denoting the absence of a consistent miRNA biomarker, and for
      PeCa the field of miRNAs has just recently started, with only a few studies
      attempting to explore their clinical usefulness. CONCLUSION: Technological
      advances influencing miRNA detection and quantification will be instrumental to
      continue to move forward with implementation of miRNAs in the clinic as
      biomarkers for non-invasive diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment monitoring 
      and follow-up. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Opioid Rotation and Conversion Ratios Used by Palliative Care Professionals: An
      International Survey.
LID - 10.1089/jpm.2022.0266 [doi]
AB  - Background: The opioid rotation ratios (ORRs) and conversion ratios (CRs) used
      worldwide among palliative care (PC) professionals to perform opioid rotations
      (ORs) and route conversions may have a wide variation. Methods: We surveyed PC
      professionals on opioid ratios used through email to the Multinational
      Association of Supportive Care in Cancer's PC study group and Twitter and
      Facebook posts between September and November 2020. Results: We received 370
      responses from respondents from 53 countries: 276 (76%) were physicians, 46 (13%)
      advanced practice providers, 39 (11%), and 9 respondents did not report their
      profession. There were statistically significant variations in median CR from
      intravenous (IV) to oral morphine (2-3), IV to oral hydromorphone (2-4.5), ORR
      from IV hydromorphone to oral morphine (10-20), and ORR from transdermal fentanyl
      mcg/hour to oral morphine (2-3.5) across various groups. Conclusion: This survey 
      highlights the wide variation in ORRs and CRs among PC clinicians worldwide and
      the need for further research to standardize practice.

TI  - QbD Assisted Development of Lipidic Nanocapsules for Antiestrogenic Activity of
      Exemestane in Breast Cancer.
PG  - 1-43
LID - 10.1080/08982104.2022.2108441 [doi]
AB  - Some breast cancers are caused by hormonal imbalances, such as estrogen and
      progesterone.These hormones play a function in directing the growth of cancer
      cells. The hormone receptors in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer lead
      breast cells to proliferate out of control. Cancer therapy such as hormonal,
      targeted, radiation is still unsatisfactory because of these challenges viz. MDR 
      (Multiple drug resistance), off-targeting, severe adverse effects. A novel
      aromatase inhibitor exemestane (Exe) exhibits promising therapy in breast cancer.
      This study aims to develop and optimize Exe-loaded lipid nanocapsules (LNCs) by
      using DSPC, PF68 and olive oil as lipid, surfactant and oil phase, respectively
      and to characterize the same. The prepared nanocapsules were investigated via
      in-vitro cell culture and in-vivo animal models. The LNCs exhibited cytotoxicity 
      in MCF-7 cell lines and enhanced anti-cancer activity and reduced cardiotoxicity 
      in DMBA-induced animal model when compared to the drug. Additionally, in-vivo
      pharmacokinetics revealed a 4.2-fold increased oral bioavailability when compared
      with Exe suspension. This study demonstrated that oral administration of
      Exe-loaded LNCs holds promise for the antiestrogenic activity of exemestane in
      breast cancer.

TI  - The Role of Lymphocyte Subsets, PD-1, and FAS (CD95) in COVID-19 Cancer Patients.
LID - 10.1089/vim.2022.0036 [doi]
AB  - Lymphocytes are the main orchestrators that regulate the immune response in
      SARS-COV-2 infection. The exhaustion of T lymphocytes is a contributing factor to
      lymphopenia, which is responsible for the COVID-19 adverse outcome. However, it
      is still not demonstrated on a large scale, including cancer patients. Peripheral
      blood samples were obtained from 83 SARS-CoV2 infected cancer patients, and 29
      COVID-19 infected noncancer patients compared to 28 age-matched healthy controls.
      Lymphocyte subsets were assessed for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, PD-1, and CD95 using
      flow cytometry. The data were correlated to the patients' clinical features,
      COVID-19 severity and outcomes. Lymphopenia, and decreased CD4(+) T cells and
      CD8(+) T cells were significantly observed in COVID-19 cancer and noncancer
      patients compared to the control group (p < 0.001, for all). There was a
      significantly increased expression of CD95 and PD-1 on the NK cells, CD4(+) T
      cells, and CD8(+) T cells in COVID-19 cancer and noncancer patients in comparison
      to the control group. The increased expression of CD95 on CD8(+) T cells, as well
      as the increased expression of PD-1 on CD8(+) T cells and NK cells are
      significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection in cancer
      patients. The increased expression of CD95 and PD-1 on the CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+)
      T cells, and NK cells was observed significantly in nonsurviving patients and
      those who were admitted to the intensive care unit in COVID-19 cancer and
      noncancer patients. The increased expression of PD-1 and CD95 could be possible
      prognostic factors for COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 cancer 
      and noncancer patients.

TI  - Effect of Cannabidiol on Cyclooxygenase Type 1 and 2 Expression and Function in
      Human Neutrophils.
LID - 10.1089/can.2022.0008 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: In this study, the effects of the cannabinoid CBD were assessed on 
      cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 expression and activity in resting and activated
      human neutrophils (polymorphonuclear [PMN] leukocytes). Methods: COX expression
      was measured at the mRNA levels, whereas COX activity was assessed by
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement of prostaglandin (PG)E2. In vitro
      experiments in a standard commercial acellular assay of COX-1/COX-2 activity
      completed the study. Results: Results show that CBD profoundly inhibits
      expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA in activated PMN, however, without any
      significant consequences for PGE2 production. CBD, however, was able to induce a 
      slight but significant direct inhibition of COX-2 in the acellular model.
      Conclusion: The effects of CBD occur in the muM concentration range, which is
      attained in humans with therapeutic doses of the drug, suggesting the clinical
      relevance of these findings.

TI  - Modelling acute myeloid leukemia (AML): What's new? A transition from the
      classical to the modern.
LID - 10.1007/s13346-022-01189-4 [doi]
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignancy affecting myeloid
      cells in the bone marrow (BM) but can spread giving rise to impaired
      hematopoiesis. AML incidence increases with age and is associated with poor
      prognostic outcomes. There has been a disconnect between the success of novel
      drug compounds observed in preclinical studies of hematological malignancy and
      less than exceptional therapeutic responses in clinical trials. This review aims 
      to provide a state-of-the-art overview on the different preclinical models of AML
      available to expand insights into disease pathology and as preclinical screening 
      tools. Deciphering the complex physiological and pathological processes and
      developing predictive preclinical models are key to understanding disease
      progression and fundamental in the development and testing of new effective drug 
      treatments. Standard scaffold-free suspension models fail to recapitulate the
      complex environment where AML occurs. To this end, we review advances in
      scaffold/matrix-based 3D models and outline the most recent advances in on-chip
      technology. We also provide an overview of clinically relevant animal models and 
      review the expanding use of patient-derived samples, which offer the prospect to 
      create more "patient specific" screening tools either in the guise of 3D matrix
      models, microphysiological "organ-on-chip" tools or xenograft models and discuss 
      representative examples.

TI  - Pregnancy after pituitary surgery does not influence the recurrence of Cushing's 
      disease.
LID - 10.1007/s12020-022-03151-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Pregnancy is associated with the activation of the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can cause a misdiagnosis of Cushing's 
      syndrome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of pregnancy after
      pituitary surgery on the recurrence rate in Cushing's disease (CD) patients.
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study in a tertiary center. Between 1990 and
      2020, 355 CD patients underwent pituitary surgery. Of those, we included 113
      female patients who were </= 45 years old (median age of 32 years, 14-45), PS
      remission, a follow-up of >/=6 months (median of 122 months, 6-402) and an
      available obstetric history. Recurrence was defined as the diagnosis of Cushing's
      syndrome via at least two altered first-line methods. The patients were divided
      into two subgroups according to pregnancy: no pregnancy or pregnancy prior to CD 
      diagnosis (NP/PP) and pregnancy after CD pituitary surgery (PA). RESULTS:
      Overall, recurrence occurred in 43 out of 113 patients (38%). A higher recurrence
      rate was seen in the PA subgroup (11/22, 50%), but there was no significant
      difference between the NP/PP subgroup (32/91, 35%). No difference in
      survival-free recurrence (SFR) was found between NP/PP and PA subgroups. The
      lower SFR was related to a higher PS plasma ACTH and normal pituitary at
      pathological analyses. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in the recurrence
      rate in patients according to pregnancy history. Other studies with higher
      numbers of patients are needed to confirm these data.

TI  - A spotlight on avoidance coping to manage fear of recurrence among breast cancer 
      survivors in an eHealth intervention.
LID - 10.1007/s10865-022-00349-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fear of recurrence (FoR) is prevalent among breast cancer survivors
      (BCS) and may be exacerbated by avoidance coping. This study examined BCS with
      avoidance coping and their engagement in a FoR eHealth intervention (FoRtitude). 
      METHODS: BCS (N = 196) with elevated FoR participated in FoRtitude.
      Patient-reported measures assessed avoidance coping with FoR and baseline
      emotional and behavioral health. Intervention engagement was measured
      quantitatively (e.g., website logins, telecoaching attendance) and qualitatively 
      (i.e., telecoaching notes). RESULTS: 38 BCS (19%) endorsed avoidance coping,
      which was associated with more severe post-traumatic anxiety-related symptoms and
      worse global mental health (ps < .05), but not anxiety (p = .19), depression (p =
      .11), physical health (p = .12), alcohol consumption (p = .85), or physical
      activity (p = .39). Avoidance coping was not associated with engagement levels
      (ps > .05) but did characterize engagement-related motivators and barriers.
      CONCLUSIONS: Avoidance coping was not a barrier to FoRtitude engagement. eHealth 
      delivery is a promising modality for engaging survivors with avoidance coping in 
      FoR interventions.

TI  - Endoscopic management of familial adenomatous polyposis targeting colorectal
      lesions greater than 5 mm in size: a single-center retrospective study.
LID - 10.1007/s10689-022-00308-x [doi]
AB  - Preserving the colon while preventing colorectal cancer is challenging in
      patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. Although prophylactic colectomy is 
      the current standard of care, some patients with familial adenomatous polyposis
      may wish to postpone colectomy as long as polyposis can be managed by endoscopic 
      resection. This study examined our endoscopic management and prognostic results
      for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who refused to undergo
      colectomy. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 12 patients with familial
      adenomatous polyposis treated at our hospital between January 1995 and December
      2020. All patients opted to postpone prophylactic colectomy although they had
      significant polyp burdens and underwent endoscopic management, in which
      colorectal polyps sized > 5 mm were thoroughly resected during baseline
      colonoscopies and subsequently, newly arising colorectal polyps sized > 5 mm were
      periodically resected during surveillance colonoscopies. Patients (median age, 33
      years) were followed up for a median of 5.2 years. The median number of
      colonoscopies and resected lesions per patient was 2 and 14 at baseline as well
      as, 9 and 32 during surveillance, respectively. The interval between
      colonoscopies was 1.0 and 7.0 months for baseline and surveillance, respectively.
      The colons of all 12 patients were preserved, and no invasive colorectal cancer
      developed. In 10 patients, 35 cases of high-grade dysplasia were observed and
      managed by endoscopic resection. Repeated endoscopic resection of colorectal
      polyps sized > 5 mm with appropriate surveillance may be an alternative form of
      endoscopic management for patients with familial adenomatous polyposis wishing to
      postpone colectomy.

TI  - PEG@ Carbon Nanotubes Composite as an Effective Nanocarrier of Ixazomib for
      Myeloma Cancer Therapy.
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/s11671-022-03707-2 [doi]
AB  - In this work, the preparation of a PEG@ multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
      composite has shown a great potential effect in tumor therapy using graphite
      powder at room temperature. PEGylated MWCNTs were created and used as a carrier
      for targeting the antineoplastic drug Ixazomib to myeloma cancer cells (abnormal 
      plasma cells). Ixazomib (MLN2238) was covalently encapsulated into functionalized
      carbon nanotubes modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG 600) to obtain
      MWCNTs-PEG-MLN2238. The Ixazomib@ MWCNTs-PEG composite shows promising results as
      an effective nanocarrier and using a small amount of MWCNTs-PEG-Ixazomib that has
      a low toxicity compared with that of Ixazomib alone. A multifunctional
      MWCNTs-PEG-Ixazomib composite is used to test biological effects on multiple
      myeloma cell lines RPMI 8226 using the MTT assay to enhance treatment efficiency.
      The cytotoxicity of free Ixazomib citrate (69% cell viability of RPMI8226 cells) 
      was higher than that of MWCNTs-PEG-Ixazomib (91% cell viability) at the same
      maximum concentration of Ixazomib citrate (50 microg/ml). In this work, we
      performed a study of preparation of MWCNTs with an acceptable Ixazomib loading
      efficiency and determination of the drug systemic toxicity for the first time. In
      this study, the preparation of MWCNTs with acceptable Ixazomib loading efficiency
      and determination of the drug systemic toxicity was performed for the first time.
      The MTT assay results show decreasing the toxicity of Ixazomib after loading with
      the MWCNTs-PEG composite. The MWCNTs-PEG @ Ixazomib show promising results as an 
      effective carrier of Ixazomib and lead to a decrease in the cost of using
      Ixazomib.

TI  - Exosomal circKDM4A Induces CUL4B to Promote Prostate Cancer Cell Malignancy in a 
      miR-338-3p-Dependent Manner.
LID - 10.1007/s10528-022-10251-2 [doi]
AB  - Circular RNA lysine demethylase 4A (circKDM4A) is also named circ_0012098 and its
      abnormal expression has been confirmed in serum exosomes of prostate cancer (PC) 
      patients. However, whether PC progression involves the exosomal circ_0012098
      remains unknown. RNA expression of circKDM4A, microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p) and
      cullin 4B (CUL4B) was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
      reaction. Protein expression was checked by Western blot. The positive expression
      rate of nuclear proliferation marker (ki-67) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry
      assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation assay were used
      to identify the interaction between miR-338-3p and circKDM4A or CUL4B. Mouse
      model assay was performed to determine the effect of exosomal circKDM4A on
      tumorigenesis in vivo. CircKDM4A expression was significantly upregulated in the 
      serum exosomes from PC patients compared with the exosomes from healthy
      volunteers. Exosomes treatment promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion
      of PC cells but inhibited apoptosis; however, these effects were attenuated after
      circKDM4A knockdown. Meanwhile, circKDM4A depletion restored exosome-increased
      circKDM4A expression. Additionally, circKDM4A acted as a miR-338-3p sponge, and
      miR-338-3p bound to CUL4B in PC cells. CircKDM4A regulated the effect of
      exosome-induced PC cell malignancy by interacting with miR-338-3p and CUL4B.
      Moreover, circKDM4A silencing relieved exosome-induced tumor growth in vivo.
      Exosomal circKDM4A promoted PC malignant progression by the miR-338-3p/CUL4B
      axis, providing a therapeutic target for PC.

TI  - YAP1 acts as a negative regulator of pro-tumor TAZ expression in esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma.
LID - 10.1007/s13402-022-00695-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Although YAP1 and TAZ are believed to be equivalent downstream effectors
      of the Hippo pathway, differential expression of YAP1 or TAZ suggests distinct
      functions during cancer progression. The exact role of YAP1 and TAZ in esophageal
      cancer, the 6th leading cancer-related mortality in the world, remains elusive.
      METHODS: Following single or double manipulation of YAP1 or TAZ expression, we
      subjected these manipulated cells to proliferation, migration, invasion, and
      xenograft tumorigenesis assays. We used RT-qPCR and Western blotting to examine
      their expression in the manipulated cells with or without inhibition of
      transcription or translation. We also examined the impact of YAP1 or TAZ
      deregulation on clinical outcome of esophageal cancer patients from the TCGA
      database. RESULTS: We found that YAP1 functions as a tumor suppressor whereas TAZ
      exerts pro-tumor functions in esophageal cancer cells. We also found a
      significant increase in TAZ mRNA expression upon YAP1 depletion, but not vice
      versa, despite the downregulation of CTGF and CYR61, shared targets of YAP1 and
      TAZ, in xenografted tissue cells. In addition to transcriptional regulation,
      YAP1-mediated TAZ expression was found to occur via protein synthesis. Restored
      TAZ expression mitigated YAP1-mediated suppression of cellular behavior. By
      contrast, TAZ silencing reduced the promoting effect exerted by YAP1 depletion on
      cellular behaviors. The observed anti-tumor function of YAP1 was further
      supported by a better overall survival among esophageal cancer patients with a
      high YAP1 expression. CONCLUSION: From our data we conclude that YAP1 functions
      as a suppressor and negatively regulates pro-tumor TAZ expression via
      transcriptional and translational control in esophageal cancer.

TI  - High levels of unfolded protein response component CHAC1 associates with cancer
      progression signatures in malignant breast cancer tissues.
LID - 10.1007/s12094-022-02889-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aberrant mRNA expression of a UPR component Cation transport
      regulator homolog 1 (CHAC1) has been reported to be associated with poor survival
      in breast and ovarian cancer patients, however, the expression of CHAC1 at
      protein levels in malignant breast tissues is underreported. The following study 
      aimed at analyzing CHAC1 protein expression in malignant breast cancer tissues.
      METHODS: Evaluation of CHAC1 expression in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) with
      known ER, PR, and HER2 status was carried out using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
      with CHAC1 specific antibody. The Human breast cancer tissue microarray (TMA,
      cat# BR1503f, US Biomax, Inc., Rockville, MD) was used to determine CHAC1
      expression. The analysis of CHAC1 IHC was done to determine its expression in
      terms of molecular subtypes of breast cancer, lymph node status, and
      proliferation index using Qu-Path software. Survival analysis was studied with a 
      Kaplan-Meier plotter. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of CHAC1 in breast
      cancer tissues showed significant up-regulation of CHAC1 as compared to the
      adjacent normal and benign tissues. Interestingly, CHAC1 immunostaining revealed 
      high expression in tumor tissues with high proliferation and positive lymph node 
      metastasis suggesting that CHAC1 might have an important role to play in breast
      cancer progression. Furthermore, high CHAC1 expression is associated with poor
      overall survival (OS) in large breast cancer patient cohorts. CONCLUSION: As a
      higher expression of CHAC1 was observed in tissue cores with high Ki67 index and 
      positive lymph node metastasis it may be concluded that enhanced CHAC1 expression
      correlates with proliferation and metastasis. The further analysis of breast
      cancer patients' survival data through KM plot indicated that high CHAC1
      expression is associated with a bad prognosis hinting that CHAC1 may have a
      possible prognostic significance in breast cancer.

TI  - The Incidence Rate of Sexual Behaviors Among Cisgender Men who have Sex with Men 
      Attending a Sexual Health Clinic.
LID - 10.1007/s10508-022-02370-z [doi]
AB  - Although nuanced parameterization of sexual behavior may improve estimates from
      mathematical models of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted
      infection transmission, prospective estimates of the incidence of specific sexual
      behaviors among men who have sex with men (MSM) are limited. From December 2014
      to July 2018, MSM with and without nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) completed
      weekly diaries over 3-12 weeks. Incidence rates of any sex, receptive anal sex,
      insertive anal sex, insertive oral sex, receptive rimming, and receptive
      hand-penile contact were 1.19, 0.28, 0.66, 0.90, 0.24, and 0.85 episodes per
      person-week, respectively, among 104 MSM with NGU at baseline, and 1.33, 0.54,
      0.32, 0.95, 0.44, and 0.88 episodes per person-week, respectively, among 25 MSM
      without NGU at baseline. Most receptive anal sex (NGU + 83%, NGU - 86%) and
      insertive anal sex (NGU + 85%, NGU - 76%) episodes were condomless. MSM engaged
      in sex just over once per week, and condom use was infrequent. Insertive oral sex
      and receptive hand-penile contact were the most common behaviors.

TI  - Local Therapy for Oligoprogression or Consolidation in High Mutational Burden
      Stage 4 Colorectal Cancer Treated With PD-1 or PD-L1 Blockade.
LID - 10.1245/s10434-022-12095-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICI) of programmed cell death protein 1
      (PD-1) or PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) can induce durable responses in patients who have
      colorectal cancer (CRC) with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB). Two recurring 
      clinical dilemmas show how to manage oligoprogressive disease and stable disease 
      after ICI. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted to analyze patients with
      metastatic CRC who underwent PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade. Tumors were mismatch repair 
      (MMR) deficient or had more than 25 mutations per megabase. Patients were
      identified who had local therapy (surgery, ablation, or radiotherapy) for one to 
      three sites of progressive disease (PD) or surgery to consolidate SD. The study
      evaluated clinical and biologic factors associated with patient selection,
      outcomes, and pathologic response rates. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2020, treatment
      was administered to 111 patients with ICI. Of these 111 patients, 19 (17%)
      survived fewer than 6 months, whereas to date, 50 have not had progression of
      disease. The remaining 42 patients experienced PD, and 16 (38%) were treated with
      local therapy for oligoprogression. Selection for local therapy was associated
      with response to ICI. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) after local
      therapy was 62%. Finally, 6 of the 50 patients without PD had consolidation of
      SD, and 5 had complete or near complete pathologic responses. CONCLUSIONS:
      Oligoprogression, a frequent pattern of failure after ICI, can be managed
      effectively with local therapy. In contrast, it may not be necessary to
      consolidate SD for selected patients. Further research is essential to define
      management algorithms better and to explore heterogeneity in response patterns.

TI  - Impact of Cytoreductive Surgery with Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy in
      the Treatment of Gastric Cancer with Peritoneal Carcinomatosis: A Systematic
      Review and Meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1245/s10434-022-12312-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite promising results, the effectiveness of cytoreductive surgery
      (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in patients with
      gastric cancer with peritoneal carcinomatosis (GCPC) has not been systematically 
      evaluated. The aim of this systematic review is to compare the survival,
      complications and risk of recurrence between CRS + HIPEC versus CRS alone in
      GCPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed in MEDLINE and Web 
      of Science according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Primary studies with patients with GCPC older 
      than 18 years were included. Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies
      (MINORS) criteria were used to assess the quality of the studies. We performed
      random-effects meta-analysis of risk ratios (RR). We assessed heterogeneity using
      the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the qualitative and
      four in the quantitative analysis. The overall survival (OS) rate after 1 year
      was 3.65 times higher for CRS + HIPEC than CRS alone [RR = 3.65, 95% confidence
      interval (95% CI) = 1.01-13.26, I(2) = 73%]. The OS rate after 5 years was more
      than three times higher for CRS + HIPEC than for CRS alone (RR = 3.25, 95% CI =
      1.28-8.26, I(2) = 8%). No significant differences between CRS + HIPEC and CRS
      alone related to complications were found (RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.83-1.33, I(2) = 
      0%). The risk of peritoneal recurrence was significantly lower for CRS + HIPEC
      than for CRS alone (RR = 0.23, 95% CI = 0.11-0.48, I(2) = 40%). The results may
      be associated with some information or indication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Results
      should be analysed cautiously given the detected heterogeneity and limitations of
      included studies. However, treatment with CRS + HIPEC seems to increase the
      survival of patients with GCPC, more than treatment with CRS alone, decrease the 
      risk of peritoneal recurrence and not be associated with more complications.

TI  - Contribution of BRCA1 5382insC mutation to triplene-gative and luminal types of
      breast cancer in Ukraine.
LID - 10.1007/s10549-022-06692-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The gene BRCA1 plays a key role in DNA repair in breast and ovarian cell
      lines and this is considered one of target tumor suppressor genes in same line of
      cancers. The 5382insC mutation is among the most frequently detected in patients 
      (Eastern Europe) with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In Ukraine, there is 
      not enough awareness of necessity to test patients with TNBC for BRCA1 mutations.
      That is why this group of patients is not well-studied, even through is known the
      mutation may affect the course of disease. METHODS: The biological samples of 408
      female patients were analyzed of the 5382insC mutation in BRCA1. We compared the 
      frequency of the 5382insC mutation in BRCA1 gene observed in Ukraine with known
      frequencies in other countries. RESULTS: For patients with TNBC, BRCA1 mutations 
      frequency was 11.3%, while in patients with luminal types of breast cancers, the 
      frequency was 2.8%. Prevalence of 5382insC among TNBC patients reported in this
      study was not different from those in Tunisia, Poland, Russia, and Bulgaria, but 
      was higher than in Australia and Germany. CONCLUSION: The BRCA1 c.5382 mutation
      rate was recorded for the first time for TNBC patients in a Ukrainian population.
      The results presented in this study underscore the importance of this genetic
      testing of mutations in patients with TNBC. Our study supports BRCA1/2 genetic
      testing for all women diagnosed with TNBC, regardless of the age of onset or
      family history of cancer and not only for women diagnosed with TNBC at <60y.o.,
      as guidelines recommend.

TI  - Life with a stoma across five European countries-a cross-sectional study on
      long-term rectal cancer survivors.
LID - 10.1007/s00520-022-07293-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Stoma-related problems are known to be important to patients and
      potentially affect everyday life. The prevalence of stoma-related problems in
      rectal cancer survivors remains undetermined. This study aimed to examine aspects
      of life with a long-term stoma, stoma management, and stoma-related problems and 
      explore the impact of stoma-related problems on daily life. METHODS: In total,
      2262 patients from 5 European countries completed a multidimensional survey.
      Stoma-related problems were assessed using the Colostomy Impact score.
      Multivariable regression analysis, after adjusting for potential confounding
      factors, provided odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
      stoma-related problems' association with restrictions in daily life. RESULTS: The
      2262 rectal cancer survivors completed the questionnaire at a median of 5.4 years
      (interquartile range 3.8-7.6) after stoma formation. In the total sample, leakage
      (58%) and troublesome odour (55%) were most prevalent followed by skin problems
      (27%) and pain (21%). Stoma-related problems were more prevalent in patients with
      parastomal bulging. A total of 431 (19%) reported feeling restricted in daily
      activities in life with a stoma. Leakage, odour, skin problems, stool
      consistency, and frequent appliance changes were significantly associated with
      restrictions in daily life. The highest risk of experiencing restrictions was
      seen for patients having odour (OR 2.74 [95% CI: 1.99-3.78]) more than once a
      week and skin problems (OR 1.77 [95% CI: 1.38-2.27]). CONCLUSION: In this large
      cohort with rectal cancer, stoma-related problems were highly prevalent and
      impacted daily life. Supportive care strategies should entail outreach to
      patients with a long-term stoma.

TI  - [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: first
      clinical experience from a pilot study including biodistribution and dose
      estimates.
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05925-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted PET/CT has become
      increasingly important in the management of prostate cancer, especially in
      localization of biochemical recurrence (BCR). PSMA-targeted PET/CT imaging with
      long-lived radionuclides as (89)Zr (T1/2 = 78.4 h) may improve diagnostics by
      allowing data acquisition on later time points. In this study, we present our
      first clinical experience including preliminary biodistribution and dosimetry
      data of [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in patients with BCR of prostate cancer.
      METHODS: Seven patients with BCR of prostate cancer who revealed no (n = 4) or
      undetermined (n = 3) findings on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging were referred 
      to [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT. PET/CT imaging was performed 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 
      72 h post injection (p.i.) of 111 +/- 11 MBq [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 (mean +/-
      standard deviation). Normal organ distribution and dosimetry were determined.
      Lesions visually considered as suggestive of prostate cancer were quantitatively 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Intense physiological uptake was observed in the salivary and 
      lacrimal glands, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine and urinary tract. The parotid
      gland received the highest absorbed dose (0.601 +/- 0.185 mGy/MBq), followed by
      the kidneys (0.517 +/- 0.125 mGy/MBq). The estimated overall effective dose for
      the administration of 111 MBq was 10.1 mSv (0.0913 +/- 0.0118 mSv/MBq). In 6
      patients, and in particular in 3 of 4 patients with negative [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT, at least one prostate cancer lesion was detected in [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617
      PET/CT imaging at later time points. The majority of tumor lesions were first
      visible at 24 h p.i. with continuously increasing tumor-to-background ratio over 
      time. All tumor lesions were detectable at 48 h and 72 h p.i. CONCLUSION:
      [(89)Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT imaging is a promising new diagnostic tool with
      acceptable radiation exposure for patients with prostate cancer especially when
      [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging fails detecting recurrent disease. The long
      half-life of (89)Zr enables late time point imaging (up to 72 h in our study)
      with increased tracer uptake in tumor lesions and higher tumor-to-background
      ratios allowing identification of lesions non-visible on [(68)Ga]Ga-PSMA-11
      PET/CT imaging.

TI  - Marangoni effect and cell spreading.
LID - 10.1007/s00249-022-01612-1 [doi]
AB  - Cells are very sensitive to the shear stress (SS). However, undesirable SS is
      generated during physiological process such as collective cell migration (CCM)
      and influences the biological processes such as morphogenesis, wound healing and 
      cancer invasion. Despite extensive research devoted to study the SS generation
      caused by CCM, we still do not fully understand the main cause of SS appearance. 
      An attempt is made here to offer some answers to these questions by considering
      the rearrangement of cell monolayers. The SS generation represents a consequence 
      of natural and forced convection. While forced convection is dependent on cell
      speed, the natural convection is induced by the gradient of tissue surface
      tension. The phenomenon is known as the Marangoni effect. The gradient of tissue 
      surface tension induces directed cell spreading from the regions of lower tissue 
      surface tension to the regions of higher tissue surface tension and leads to the 
      cell sorting. This directional cell migration is described by the Marangoni flux.
      The phenomenon has been recognized during the rearrangement of (1) epithelial
      cell monolayers and (2) mixed cell monolayers made by epithelial and mesenchymal 
      cells. The consequence of the Marangoni effect is an intensive spreading of
      cancer cells through an epithelium. In this work, a review of existing literature
      about SS generation caused by CCM is given along with the assortment of published
      experimental findings, to invite experimentalists to test given theoretical
      considerations in multicellular systems.

TI  - Long-term Oncological Outcomes after Colorectal Anastomotic Leakage; A
      Retrospective Dutch Population Based Study.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005647 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of anastomotic leak (AL) after colon cancer
      (CC) and rectal cancer (RC) surgery on 5-year relative survival, disease-free
      survival and disease recurrence. BACKGROUND: AL after CC and RC resection is a
      severe postoperative complication with conflicting evidence whether it
      deteriorates long-term outcomes. METHODS: Patients with stage I-IV CC and RC who 
      underwent resection with primary anastomosis were included from the Netherlands
      Cancer Registry (2008-2018). Relative survival, measured from day of resection,
      and multivariable relative excess risks (RER) were analyzed. Disease-free
      survival and recurrence were evaluated in a subset with stage I-III patients
      operated in 2015. All analyses were performed with patients who survived 90-days 
      postoperatively. RESULTS: 65,299 CC and 22,855 RC patients were included.
      Five-year relative survival after CC resection with and without AL was 95% versus
      100%, 89% versus 94%, 66% versus 76%, and 28% versus 25% for stage I to IV
      disease. AL was associated with a significantly higher RER for death in stage II 
      and III CC patients. Stage-specific 5-year relative survival in RC patients with 
      and without AL was 97% versus 101%, 90% versus 95%, 74% versus 83%, and 32%
      versus 41%. AL was associated with a significantly higher RER for death in stage 
      III and IV RC patients. Disease- free survival was significantly lower in CC
      patients with AL, but disease recurrence was not associated with AL after CRC
      resection. CONCLUSION: AL has a stage-dependent negative impact on survival in
      both colon and rectal cancer, but no independent association with disease
      recurrence.

TI  - Microsatellite instability and oncological outcomes in Thai patients with
      endometrial cancer.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106557 [doi]
AB  - Here, we determined the frequency of microsatellite instability (MSI) and the
      impact of MSI-high (MSI-H) on clinical outcomes of Thai patients with endometrial
      cancer (EC). Tissue samples of 110 Thai patients with EC, who had undergone
      surgical staging, were tested for mismatch repair (MMR) gene deficiency, and the 
      patients were grouped into MSI-H and MSI-stable (MSI-S) groups; 24.5% had MSI-H. 
      Unlike MSI-S group patients, MSI-H group patients had synchronous and
      metachronous cancer. They showed better 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) than
      those in the MSI-S group (p=.182; 92.3% vs. 82.6%). The 3-year overall survival
      was 96.2% in MSI-H and 86.4% in MSI-S groups (p=.163). Multivariate analyses
      showed lower uterine involvement (p=.004), myometrial invasion >/=50% (p=.032),
      lymphovascular space invasion (p<.001) and MSI-S (p=.006) as prognostic factors
      for DFS. Our study showed that the prevalence of MMR gene deficiency in Thai
      patients with EC is common and associated with better outcomes.Impact
      StatementWhat is already known on this subject? Microsatellite instability (MSI) 
      occurs in approximately 20-40% of endometrial cancer (EC) cases. MSI analysis in 
      EC can identify patients at higher risk of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
      cancer and those having prognostic factors. Additionally, it is predictive of
      immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. However, current evidence shows a
      correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and EC prognosis. Studies
      on EC and MSI status effect on survival outcome have yielded inconsistent results
      regarding the pathological significance of MSI in such malignancies.What do the
      results of this study add? The prevalence of mismatch repair (MMR) gene
      deficiency in Thai patients with EC is common (24.5%) and associated with better 
      outcomes.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or
      further research? This study highlights the prevalence and impact of MSI on
      oncological outcomes in patients with EC in a low-incidence country. Future
      studies should focus on the detection of germline mutation to understand the
      accurate prevalence of Lynch syndrome in Thai patients with EC.

TI  - Poorly Cohesive Gastric Cancers Showing the Transcriptomic Hallmarks of
      Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Behave Aggressively.
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005648 [doi]
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Poorly cohesive (PC) gastric cancer (GC) exhibits variable clinical
      behaviour, being extremely aggressive in most cases but more indolent at times.
      We hypothesized that the integrative genomic and gene expression characterization
      of a PC GC series could help identifying molecular subtypes with potential
      clinical implications. METHODS: 64 PC GCs were assessed for alterations in 409
      genes and 30 cases were subjected to transcriptomic profiling of 20,815 genes.
      RESULTS: A median of 8.2 mutations per Mb (IQR 6.9-10.4) was found and a tumor
      mutational load >10 muts/Mb was significantly associated with patients' worse
      survival (P=0.0024). The most frequent mutated genes were CDH1 and TP53 (each
      32.8%) followed by PIK3CA (10.9%). In 15 samples (23.4%), at least one chromatin 
      remodelling gene was mutated: KMT2D (5 cases); ARID1A and BAP1 (4 cases each);
      EZH2, KMT2A, PBRM1 (1 case each). Eight samples (12.5%) had fusion genes
      involving CLDN18 gene. Gene expression profiling identified 4 different clusters:
      cluster A associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature;
      cluster B associated to proliferative signature and EMT; cluster C correlated to 
      hedgehog signalling; cluster D showing no enrichment for any of the previous
      signatures. Notably, cluster A and B showed a worse prognosis compared with
      clusters C and D (P=0.0095). CONCLUSION: integrated genomic and transcriptomic
      analysis suggest the existence of 4 molecular subtypes of PC GC with prognostic
      significance where EMT features are associated with a worse outcome.

TI  - Signaling new therapeutic opportunities: cytokines in prostate cancer.
LID - 10.1080/14712598.2022.2108701 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite FDA approval of sipuleucel-T in 2010, endeavors to use
      immune checkpoint inhibitors in unselected prostate cancer patients have not
      improved clinical outcomes. These efforts include studies with anti-PD1/PD-L1 and
      anti-CTLA-4 alone and in combination with existing standards of care. These
      strategies are generally T-cell centric and disregard the broader complex and
      pleiotropic components of the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment such as
      natural killer cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor associated
      macrophages. AREAS COVERED: We performed an online literature search and
      undertook a review of existing pre-clinical and clinical literature for
      cytokine-based therapy relating to prostate cancer, specifically on interleukin
      (IL)-2, IL-15, IL-12, IL-23, IL-8 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta.
      EXPERT OPINION: Cytokine-based therapies present an alternative immune strategy
      to target the pleiotropic prostate cancer tumor microenvironment beyond T-cells. 
      Future immunotherapy strategies in prostate cancer should address these immune
      cell populations which may play more important roles in the prostate cancer tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - Immune checkpoint inhibitors increase the risk of kidney transplant rejection: a 
      real-world pharmacovigilance study.
LID - 10.1080/14740338.2022.2110234 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients with cancer are at higher risk of kidney
      transplant rejection (KTR), and the safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
      is unclear. The present study investigates the relationship between ICIs and KTR 
      using data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System
      (FAERS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Case reports of KTR inducted by ICIs in
      FAERS from January 1, 2011, to June 30, 2021, were collected, and a
      disproportionate analysis was performed to assess the correlation between ICIs
      and KTR. RESULTS: A total of 99 cases of ICI-related KTR were reported in the
      FAERS database. Most of them were male patients (n=63, 84.0%), and more than half
      of patients suffered from malignant melanoma (n=46, 52.9%). The median onset time
      after the medication was 22 days, the withdrawal rates of ICIs were 78.0%, and
      the overall death rate was 29.3%. In general, there was a significant relevance
      between ICIs and KTR (ROR=3.92[3.21-4.79] IC025=1.56), of which PD-1 was the most
      prominent (n=81 ROR=5.26[4.22-6.57] IC025=1.86). CONCLUSIONS: ICIs may increase
      the risk of KTR in organ transplant recipients with cancer.

      metastatic colorectal cancer.
LID - CCR-22-0655 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0655 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy and safety of high-dose vitamin C plus FOLFOX
      +/- bevacizumab versus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab as first-line treatment in patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2017 and 
      2019, histologically confirmed mCRC patients (n = 442) with normal
      glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase status and no prior treatment for metastatic
      disease were randomized (1:1) into a control (FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab) and an
      experimental (high-dose vitamin C [1.5 g/kg/d, intravenously for 3 hours from D1 
      to D3] plus FOLFOX +/- bevacizumab) group. Randomization was based on the primary
      tumor location and bevacizumab prescription. RESULTS: The progression-free
      survival (PFS) of the experimental group was not superior to the control group
      (median PFS, 8.6 vs 8.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 0.70-1.05; P = 0.1). The objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival
      (OS) of the experimental and control group were similar (ORR, 44.3% vs 42.1%; P =
      0.9; median OS, 20.7 vs 19.7 months; P = 0.7). Grade 3 or higher
      treatment-related adverse events occurred in 33.5% and 30.3% of patients in the
      experimental and control group, respectively. In prespecified subgroup analyses, 
      patients with RAS mutation had significantly longer PFS (median PFS, 9.2 vs 7.8
      months; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.50-0.91; P = 0.01) with vitamin C added to
      chemotherapy than with chemotherapy only. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose vitamin C plus
      chemotherapy failed to show superior PFS compared with chemotherapy in mCRC
      patients as first-line treatment but may be beneficial in mCRC patients harboring
      RAS mutation.

TI  - STAT3 activation as a predictive biomarker for ruxolitinib response in head and

LID - CCR-22-0744 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0744 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Increased activity of STAT3 is associated with progression of head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Upstream activators of STAT3, such as JAKs,
      represent potential targets for therapy of solid tumors, including HNSCC. In this
      study we investigated the anti-cancer effects of ruxolitinib, a clinical JAK1/2
      inhibitor, in HNSCC preclinical models including patient-derived xenografts
      (PDXs) from patients treated on a window-of-opportunity trial. METHODS: HNSCC
      cell lines were treated with ruxolitinib, and the impact on activated STAT3
      levels, cell growth, and colony formation was assessed. PDXs were generated from 
      HNSCC patients who received a brief course of neoadjuvant ruxolitinib on a
      clinical trial. The impact of ruxolitinib on tumor growth and STAT3 activation
      was assessed. RESULTS: Ruxolitinib inhibited STAT3 activation, cellular growth
      and colony formation of HNSCC cell lines. Ruxolitinib treatment of mice bearing a
      HNSCC cell line-derived xenograft significantly inhibited tumor growth compared
      with vehicle-treated controls. The response of HNSCC PDXs derived from patients
      on the clinical trial mirrored the responses seen in the neoadjuvant setting.
      Baseline active STAT3 (pSTAT3) and total STAT3 levels were lower, and ruxolitinib
      inhibited STAT3 activation in a PDX from a patient whose disease was stable on
      ruxolitinib, compared to a PDX from a patient whose disease progressed on
      ruxolitinib and where ruxolitinib treatment had minimal impact on STAT3
      activation. CONCLUSIONS: Ruxolitinib exhibits antitumor effects in HNSCC
      preclinical models. Baseline pSTAT3 or total STAT3 levels in the tumor may serve 
      as predictive biomarkers to identify patients most likely to respond to
      ruxolitinib.

TI  - Preclinical characterization of AZD5305, a next generation, highly selective
      PARP1 inhibitor and trapper.
LID - CCR-22-0301 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0301 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We hypothesized that inhibition and trapping of PARP1 alone would be
      sufficient to achieve anti-tumor activity. In particular, we aimed to achieve
      selectivity over PARP2, which has been shown to a play role in the survival of
      hematopoietic/stem progenitor cells in animal models. We developed AZD5305 with
      the aim to achieve improved clinical efficacy and wider therapeutic window. This 
      next generation PARPi could provide a paradigm shift in clinical outcomes
      achieved by first generation PARPi, particularly in combination. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: AZD5305 was tested in vitro for PARylation inhibition, PARP-DNA trapping
      and antiproliferative abilities. In vivo efficacy was determined in mouse
      xenograft and PDX models. The potential for hematological toxicity was evaluated 
      in rat models as monotherapy and combination. RESULTS: AZD5305 is a highly potent
      and selective inhibitor of PARP1 with 500-fold selectivity for PARP1 over PARP2. 
      AZD5305 inhibits growth in cells with deficiencies in DNA repair, with minimal/no
      effects in other cells. Unlike first generation PARPi, AZD5305 has minimal
      effects on hematological parameters in a rat pre-clinical model at predicted
      clinically efficacious exposures. Animal models treated with AZD5305 at doses
      >/=0.1mg/kg QD achieved greater depth of tumor regression compared to olaparib
      100mg/kg QD, and longer duration of response. CONCLUSIONS: AZD5305 potently and
      selectively inhibits PARP1 resulting in excellent antiproliferative activity and 
      unprecedented selectivity for DNA repair deficient versus proficient cells. These
      data confirm the hypothesis that targeting only PARP1 can retain therapeutic
      benefits of non-selective PARPi, while reducing potential for hematotoxicity.
      AZD5305 is currently in Ph1 trials (NCT04644068).

LID - CCR-22-0094 [pii]
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0094 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Determine the safety and specificity of a tumor-targeted radiotracer
      (89Zr-pan) in combination with 18F-FDG PET/CT to improve diagnostic accuracy in
      head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adult
      patients with biopsy-proven HNSCC scheduled for standard of care surgery were
      enrolled in a clinical trial and underwent systemic administration of
      89Zirconium-panitumumab and panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by preoperative
      89Zr-pan PET/CT and intraoperative fluorescence imaging. The sensitivity,
      specificity, and AUC were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of fourteen patients were
      enrolled and completed the study. Four patients (28.5%) had areas of high 18F-FDG
      uptake outside the head and neck region with maximum standardized uptake values
      (SUVmax) greater than 2.0 that were not detected on 89Zr-pan PET/CT. These four
      patients with incidental findings underwent further workup and had no evidence of
      cancer on biopsy or clinical follow-up. Forty-eight lesions (primary tumor, LNs, 
      incidental findings) with SUVmax ranging 2.0 - 23.6 were visualized on 18F-FDG
      PET/CT; 34 lesions on 89Zr-pan PET/CT with SUVmax ranging 0.9 - 10.5. The
      combined ability of 18F-FDG PET/CT and 89Zr-pan PET/CT to detect HNSCC in the
      whole body was improved with higher specificity of 96.3% (confidence interval
      (CI) 89.2 - 100%) compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT alone with specificity of 74.1% (CI 
      74.1 - 90.6%). One possibly related grade 1 adverse event of prolonged QTc (460
      ms) was reported but resolved in follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: 89Zr-pan PET/CT imaging 
      is safe and may be valuable in discriminating incidental findings identified on
      18F-FDG-PET/CT from true positive lesions and in localizing metastatic LNs.

      telomeres.
LID - 10.1080/17474086.2022.2108784 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a multi-system syndrome characterised 
      by muco-cutaneous abnormalities, bone marrow failure and predisposition to
      cancer. Studies over the last 25 years have led to the identification of 18
      disease genes. These have a principal role in telomere maintenance and patients
      usually have very short/abnormal telomeres. The advances have also led to the
      unification of DC with a number of other diseases, now collectively referred to
      as the telomeropathies or telomere biology disorders. WHAT IS COVERED: Clinical
      features, genetics and biology of the different sub-types. Expert view on
      diagnosis, treatment of the hematological complications and future. EXPERT VIEW: 
      As these are very pleotropic disorders affecting multiple organs a high index of 
      suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis. Telomere length measurement and
      genetic analysis of the disease genes have become useful diagnostic tools.
      Although, hematological defects can respond to danazol/oxymetholone, the only
      current curative treatment for these is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) using fludarabine based conditioning protocols. New therapies are needed
      where danazol/oxymetholone are ineffective and HSCT is not feasible.

TI  - Colony stimulating factors for prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in
      children.
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2022.2110066 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Febrile neutropenia (FN) is one of the complications of
      chemotherapy that can increase the risk of infection and mortality. Granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) are used in practice to prevent and treat
      episodes of neutropenia. The use of G-CSFs in children with cancer has not been
      studied much for primary prophylaxis of FN. AREAS COVERED: Current data suggest
      that G-CSFs have a similar pharmacokinetic profile in children and adults.
      Clinical trials published from 2002 to 2021 using G-CSFs in pediatric cancer
      patients were reviewed. All evaluated clinical trials used a dosage of 5 mcg/kg
      of filgrastim daily until neutrophil recovery or a single dose of 100 mcg/kg
      pegfilgrastim. Filgrastim demonstrated the benefit in decreasing the duration of 
      fever, hospital stay, and antibiotic use in high-risk neuroblastoma patients.
      Pegfilgrastim showed similar efficacy in reducing the occurrence of FN and
      infections, with bone pain as an adverse effect. EXPERT OPINION: Filgrastim 5
      mcg/kg/day or pegfilgrastim 100 mcg/kg single dose is appropriate when given at
      least 24 hours or after the chemotherapy in pediatric patients who weigh 45 kg or
      more. More prospective randomized trials are necessary to further investigate the
      efficacy and safety of G-CSFs in children with different types of cancer.

TI  - Navigations of the targeting pathway of nanomedicines towards tumor.
LID - 10.1080/17425247.2022.2110064 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nanomedicines (NMs) have emerged as a promising approach for
      revolutionizing cancer treatment outcomes, mainly due to their benefits in the
      tumor targeted delivery of therapeutics. The preferential accumulation of NMs in 
      tumor has been widely verified by macroscopical technologies. Accordingly,
      several classic and emerging targeting mechanisms have been proposed to support
      the tumor-specific delivery of NMs. The targeting mechanism has been a topic of
      intensive interest and controversy in the field of NMs development. Especially,
      the mechanisms by which NMs target tumor remain elusive. AREA COVERED: This
      topical review mainly discussed the evolution of the targeting mechanisms,
      crucial issues associated with each mechanism, and confused debates among the
      mechanisms. The targeting mechanisms of tumor-specific NMs discussed here include
      the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, protein corona-mediated
      targeting delivery, circulating cell mediated transportation, and transcytosis.
      EXPERT OPINION: It is of great significance for ultimate clinical translation to 
      have more comprehensive considerations on the mechanism driving the pathway of
      NMs toward tumors. Our thoughts in this review are expected to provide
      comprehensive understanding on the mechanisms and elicit thorough explorations on
      new mechanism to renovate the knowledge framework of NMs delivery.

TI  - Treatment delay and treatment pattern modifications among epithelial ovarian
      cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective cohort study.
LID - 10.1002/jso.27048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
      disrupted healthcare access and medical treatment, including oncological care.
      Treatment delay in ovarian cancer could impact survival. We aimed to assess if
      there were delays and treatment changes in a cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer 
      patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer patients
      included cases diagnosed during the first 22 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in
      the state of Sao Paulo and those diagnosed in the 22 months preceding the
      outbreak. Time-to-treat was measured in days. In each group, surgery and
      chemotherapy proportions were assessed according to healthcare insurance status. 
      RESULTS: A 56.2% reduction in epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis was identified 
      during the pandemic group compared to the prepandemic group; fewer patients were 
      diagnosed in stage I (p < 0.01). Time-to-treat increased from 18.9 to 23 days (p 
      < 0.01). Surgery in the public sector fell from 74.6% to 65.3% during the
      pandemic, compared to 87.1% to 68.8% in the private sector. CONCLUSION: There
      were fewer overall diagnoses, reduced stage I diagnosis, increased time-to-treat,
      and a reduction in the proportion of patients submitted to surgery. Brazil's
      public healthcare system demonstrated a higher resiliency to treatment change
      than the private sector.

TI  - Current role of cytoreductive nephrectomy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - S79-S84
LID - 10.5152/tud.2021.21006 [doi]
AB  - Historically, immediate cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) was considered the
      standard of care in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) who were
      fit enough to undergo surgery. Recently, 2 randomized controlled trials, SURTIME 
      and CARMENA, have questioned the role of immediate CN and initiated an ongoing
      debate on the proper indications and timing of CN. Although some patients still
      benefit from immediate CN, other patients require immediate systemic treatment,
      and some of them might benefit from deferred CN in the absence of disease
      progression. This study provides an overview of the history of CN, an in-depth
      analysis of SURTIME and CARMENA, and highlights the current indications for
      performing immediate or deferred CN.

TI  - The effects of REG4 expression on chemoresistance of ovarian cancer.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106834 [doi]
AB  - Although ovarian cancer usually responds well to platinum- and taxane-based
      first-line chemotherapy, most patients develop recurrence and chemoresistance.
      Regenerating gene 4 (REG4) is a secretory protein involved in cell
      differentiation and proliferation. We found higher REG4 expression in ovarian
      cancer than in normal tissues (p < .05). Regenerating gene 4 expression was
      negatively associated with overall, progression-free or post-progression survival
      rates of patients with ovarian cancer receiving platinum or paclitaxel treatment 
      (p < .05) according to a Kaplan-Meier plotter. Regenerating gene 4 overexpression
      resulted in either cisplatin or paclitaxel resistance, and apoptosis resistance
      in CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells (p < .05). REG4-transfected ovarian cancer cells
      showed stronger migration and invasion treated with cisplatin or paclitaxel (p < 
      .05). Additionally, cisplatin or paclitaxel exposure led to the overexpression of
      phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (p-PI3K), p-Akt, phosphorylated
      mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR), glutathione S-transferase-pi, survivin,
      and B-cell lymphoma 2 in REG4 transfectants compared with control cells (p <
      .05). These findings suggested that REG4 expression was up-regulated in ovarian
      cancer, and associated with poor survival and chemotherapy resistance. REG4
      promoted the occurrence, development, and chemotherapy resistance of ovarian
      cancer by regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion, and 
      PI3K/Akt/m-TOR signalling pathways. IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this
      subject? REG4 mRNA expression is up-regulated in many digestive cancers. High
      REG4 expression was associated with an adverse prognosis, high tumour and nodal
      stages, poor differentiation, and hepatic and peritoneal metastases of digestive 
      cancers. REG4 expression conferred cancer cells with increased resistance to
      chemoradiotherapy, especially 5-FU-based treatment, by activating the
      MAPK/Erk/Bim signalling pathway.What do the results of this study add? REG4 was
      highly expressed in ovarian cancer. The expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, p-mTOR,
      GST-pi, survivin, and Bcl-2 was increased in REG4-overexpressing cells. High REG4
      expression was significantly associated with inferior OS, PFS, and PPS rates in
      patients with ovarian cancer receiving platinum chemotherapy. REG4 mediated
      cisplatin and paclitaxel resistance in CAOV3 ovarian cancer cells. The percentage
      of apoptotic cells was markedly lower in REG4-transfected compared to
      mock-transfected cells after cisplatin or paclitaxel treatment.What are the
      implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?
      This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of REG4 expression in
      ovarian cancer treated with platinum and paclitaxel, to explore REG4
      chemoresistance mechanisms to platinum and paclitaxel, and to provide a
      scientific experimental basis for the clinical treatment and outcome evaluation
      of ovarian cancer. In order to provide comprehensive clinical treatment of
      ovarian cancer, it is helpful to improve our understanding of multi-drug
      resistance and identify new cancer diagnostic biomarkers.

      cells of novel 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-triazolyl analogs of ribavirin. We modified
      ribavirin's carboxamide moiety to test the effects of lipophilic groups.
      1-beta-D-Ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,3-triazoles were prepared using Click Chemistry,
      whereas an unprecedented application of a prior 1,2,4-triazole ring synthesis was
      used for 1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole analogs. Though cytotoxicity
      was mediocre and there was no correlation with lipophilicity, we discovered that 
      a structurally similar concentrative nucleoside transporter 2 (CNT2) inhibitor
      was modestly cytotoxic (MCF-7 IC50 of 42 microM). These syntheses could be used
      to efficiently investigate variation in the nucleobase.

AB  - Objective: MCM3AP-AS1 has been characterized as an oncogenic long non-coding RNA 
      (lncRNA) in several cancers including papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), but its
      role in PTC has not been fully elucidated. Considering the critical role of
      lncRNAs in cancer biology, further functional analysis of MCM3AP-AS1 in PTC may
      provide novel insights into PTC management. Subjects and methods: Paired tumor
      and non-tumor tissues were collected from 63 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)
      patients. Expression levels of MCM3AP-AS1, miR-218 and GLUT1 in tissue samples
      were analyzed by qRT-PCR. Cell transfection was performed to explore the
      interactions among MCM3AP-AS1, miR-218 and GLUT1. Cell proliferation assay was
      performed to evaluate the effects of MCM3AP-AS1 and miR-218 on cell
      proliferation. Results: MCM3AP-AS1 accumulated to high levels in PTC tissues and 
      was affected by clinical stage. MCM3AP-AS1 showed a positive correlation with
      GLUT1 across PTC tissues. RNA interaction prediction showed that MCM3AP-AS1 could
      bind to miR-218, which can directly target GLUT1. MCM3AP-AS1 and miR-218 showed
      no regulatory role regulating the expression of each other, but overexpression of
      MCM3AP-AS1 upregulated GLUT1 and enhanced cell proliferation. In contrast,
      overexpression of miR-218 downregulated GLUT1 and attenuated cell proliferation. 
      In addition, miR-218 suppressed the role of MCM3AP-AS1 in regulating the
      expression of GLUT1 and cell proliferation. Conclusion: MCM3AP-AS1 may serve as a
      competing endogenous RNA of miR-218 to upregulate GLUT1 in PTC, thereby promoting
      cell proliferation. The MCM3APAS1/ miR-218/GLUT1 pathway characterized in the
      present study might serve as a potential target to treat PTC.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there has been a reduction in the
      provision of all elective services. This poses enormous pressure on urologists as
      regards to patients with bladder cancer who need intravesical Bacille Calmette
      Guerin (BCG) treatment. The evolving situation of the pandemic mandates a
      pragmatic approach in clinical decisions; to date, there are no uniform consensus
      guidelines about how to manage these patients and the factors affecting our
      decision for service provision. These concerns need to be addressed not only for 
      the current crisis but also for the upcoming next phase of the pandemic.

AB  - In this rapid review, we aimed to evaluate the effect of coronavirus disease 2019
      (COVID-19) on renal functions and mortality of patients with kidney diseases. We 
      searched MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, UpToDate,
      and TRIP databases using the following keywords: COVID-19, COVID19, 2019-nCoV,
      2019-CoV, coronavirus, SARS-nCoV-2, urology, cancer, bladder, prostate, kidney,
      trauma, stone, neurogenic, and reconstructive. The initial search resulted in 495
      records. After the primary screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts and
      removing duplicates, 10 articles were selected and included in this rapid review.
      Moreover, we performed meta-analysis of binary data for the outcomes with
      sufficient data. Owing to a high level of heterogeneity because of different
      study designs and contexts, we used a random model for the meta-analysis. Only 5 
      studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. In these studies, comprising 964
      COVID-19 positive patients, the cumulative event rate of acute kidney injury
      (AKI) was 7.1% (95% confidence interval: 1.8%-24.5%, p<0.001, I2=92.4). Based on 
      the qualitative synthesis of the 10 included studies, patients with COVID-19 and 
      kidney diseases had higher risk of in-hospital mortality. If AKI occurs because
      of the novel coronavirus, the mortality rate will be very high. Therefore, we
      need further investigations and more studies to recognize the extent and the
      cause of renal involvement in COVID-19.

TI  - Is the use of ultra-low insufflation pressure safe and feasible in robot assisted
      radical prostatectomy.
PG  - 199-204
LID - 10.5152/tud.2021.20568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current innovations in minimally invasive surgery include using
      ultra-low insufflation pressure with the aim of improving peri-operative and
      short-term clinical outcomes. Despite an exponential increase in the use of
      robotic technology, there remains limited literature supporting the use of
      ultra-low pressure during robotic surgery. We performed a feasibility study of
      ultra-low-pressure robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RARP).
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective data related to standard pressure (15 mm Hg)
      RARP (Group 1) and ultra-low-pressure (6 mm Hg) RARP (Group 2) were collected and
      compared to assess the peri-operative and short-term outcomes. RESULTS: Outcome
      data of 112 consecutive patients (56 in each group) were collected. Mean age,
      pre-operative prostate specific antigen, body mass index, and performance status 
      were similar in both groups. Mean console time was shorter in ultra-low-pressure 
      RARP group (125 minutes) than in standard pressure RARP group (138 minutes)
      (p=0.016). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in console time or
      estimated blood loss between these 2 groups for patients with RARP and lymph node
      dissection. No patients from either group required conversion to an open
      procedure or received a peri-operative blood transfusion. None of the patients in
      either group developed post-operative complications or needed readmission.
      CONCLUSION: Our study has demonstrated that ultra-low-pressure RARP is a
      practical and safe option, and it supports the routine practice of
      ultra-low-pressure RARP with slow adaptation in other complex robotic surgeries, 
      such as robotic cystectomy for bladder cancer.

      cancer: What urologists need to know.
PG  - 175-182
LID - 10.5152/tud.2021.21004 [doi]
AB  - Biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) of the prostate has emerged as an
      alternative to multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for the detection of clinically
      significant prostate cancer (csPCa). However, while the Prostate Imaging
      Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) is widely known for mpMRI, a proper PI-RADS
      for bpMRI has not yet been adopted. In this review, we report the current status 
      and the future directions of bpMRI, and propose a simplified PI-RADS (S-PI-RADS) 
      that could help radiologists and urologists in the detection and management of
      PCa.

AB  - Localization of the near-infrared (NIR) plasmonic nanoparticles at the tumor
      sites is essential for safe and efficient photothermal therapy of cancer. In this
      work, two biocompatible polymers: modified poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and
      branched polyethyleneimine (bPEI) were used to bind plasmonic hollow gold
      nanospheres HAuNS to the tumor-specific antibody, atezolizumab (ATZ). The
      photo-immunoconjugate (HAuNS-PEI-PEG-ATZ) was prepared via a simple and
      cost-effective procedure. The conjugate was also prepared with the radioiodinated
      antibody (ATZ-(131)I) to combine the targeted radiotherapy and photothermal
      cytotoxic actions against human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. In vitro study revealed
      that attachment to the antibody and the use of cellular internalizing polymers
      enhanced the cellular localization of both gold and the radiotherapeutic
      Iodine-131. Compared to bare gold nanoparticles, (HAuNS-PEI-PEG-ATZ) conjugate
      exhibited a significantly enhanced photothermal ablation of HepG2 cells after
      laser irradiation (0.4 W cm(-2), 5 minutes). Laser irradiation of the cells
      treated with the radiolabeled conjugate (HAuNS-PEI-PEG-ATZ-(131)I) exhibited the 
      highest cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells due to the combinatorial cytotoxic
      effects.

TI  - Evaluation of the Role of Intraoperative Frozen Section and Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging in Endometrial Cancer.
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.14389 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Histological type, grade, and myometrial invasion are major prognostic
      features of endometrial carcinoma since it can alter the decision-making on
      surgical procedure. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of preoperative
      endometrial biopsy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of endometrial cancer
      compared to that of intraoperative frozen section. METHODS: This retrospective
      study included 264 patients who underwent surgery with intraoperative frozen
      section for endometrial cancer at our institution between 2014 and 2018.
      Diagnosis was determined by histological type, grade, and myometrial invasion.
      Concordance rate, sensitivity, and specificity of preoperative diagnosis and
      intraoperative frozen diagnosis were calculated, in comparison to the final
      pathological diagnosis. RESULTS: Preoperative and intraoperative diagnoses showed
      no statistically significant difference in determining histological type and
      grade (p=0.152). Intraoperative diagnosis showed higher sensitivity for
      endometrioid carcinoma grade-3 and other types, and higher specificity for
      grade-1. For myometrial invasion, intraoperative diagnosis showed significantly
      higher concordance rate than preoperative MRI findings (p<0.01). Intraoperative
      diagnosis showed higher sensitivity and specificity in patients with and without 
      myometrial invasion, respectively. CONCLUSION: Higher agreement between
      intraoperative and final diagnoses, especially in myometrial invasion, suggests
      that intraoperative frozen section is a good indicator for appropriate surgical
      procedure decision-making.

      adenocarcinoma cells by targeting MAP3K2.
LID - 10.18632/aging.204198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of micro ribonucleic acid 
      (miR)-338-3p on the migration, invasion and proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma 
      (LUAD) cells. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis was employed to evaluate the
      function and expression of related genes in lung cancer. Human A549 and NCI-H1299
      cells cultured to logarithmic growth stage were assigned to negative control (NC)
      mimic group, miR-338-3p mimic group (miR-mimic group), NC inhibitor group and
      miR-338-3p inhibitor group (miR-inhibitor group) treated with or without MAP3K2
      overexpression (OE)-lentivirus, or TBHQ or FR180204. Transwell assay, cell colony
      formation assay, Western blotting and cell-cycle analysis were carried out.
      RESULTS: Bioinformatics results manifested that miR-338 and MAP3K2 were involved 
      in LUAD. The expression levels of MAP3K2, p-ERK1/2, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, cyclin
      A2 and cyclin D1 were increased after addition of miR-338-3p inhibitor,
      consistent with the raised amount of LUAD cells in migration and invasion
      experiments and number of colonies formed, as well as the cell cycle, but
      miR-338-3p mimic reversed these results. Moreover, MAP3K2 overexpression elevated
      the level of p-ERK1/2. Meanwhile, after treatment with TBHQ or FR180204, the
      influence of miR-338-3p inhibitor or mimic was also verified. CONCLUSIONS:
      MiR-338-3p overexpression can modulate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway by targeting 
      MAP3K2, thus inhibiting the migration, invasion and proliferation of human LUAD
      cells.

TI  - M1 macrophage-derived exosomes synergistically enhance the anti- bladder cancer
      effect of gemcitabine.
LID - 10.18632/aging.204200 [doi]
AB  - Gemcitabine (GEM) is one of the first choice drugs for treating bladder cancer.
      In this study, we loaded M1 macrophage-derived exosomes (M1-Exo) with GEM by
      ultrasonication technique to derive an M1-Exo-GEM drug delivery system, and then 
      explored its effects on bladder cancer. After inducing M1 polarization of
      macrophages in vitro, ultracentrifugation was performed to obtain M1-Exo,
      followed by construction of M1-Exo-GEM via ultrasonication technique. Mouse
      bladder cancer MB49 cells were chosen for study. CCK-8, PI staining and flow
      cytometry (FCM) assays were employed to assess the cell viability and apoptosis
      level. Inflammatory cytokines were detected by ELISA, while the protein
      expressions of Bcl-2, Bax and Caspase-3 were examined through Western-Blotting.
      After injecting M1-Exo-GEM into the tumor-bearing mouse model, the pathological
      changes were observed by H&E staining, the cancer cell damage was detected by
      TUNEL staining, and the apoptosis pathway activation was analyzed through
      immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and protein expression assays for Caspase-3
      and Bax. Our results showed that M1-Exo and GEM had cytotoxic effects on MB49
      cells, which increased the apoptosis level and the inflammatory cytokine
      expressions. Compared to M1-Exo and GEM, M1-Exo-GEM was significantly more
      cytotoxic to MB49 cells while markedly up-regulating the expressions of
      inflammatory cytokines. In the tumor-bearing mouse model, M1-Exo-GEM
      significantly inhibited tumor growth and damaged tumor cells, which outperformed 
      GEM. Meanwhile, it also increased the tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines.
      This study finds that the drug delivery system composed of M1-Exo and GEM can act
      synergistically with GEM to exert cytotoxicity and induce inflammatory damage of 
      bladder cancer cells.

TI  - Initial Learning Curve and Stereotypical Use of Extra Arm During da Vinci Chest
      Procedures of McKeown Esophagectomy.
PG  - 15569845221115237
LID - 10.1177/15569845221115237 [doi]
AB  - Objective: McKeown esophagectomy facilitates extensive lymphadenectomy for the
      optimal management of esophageal cancer. Robot-assisted esophagectomy (RAE) was
      introduced in an attempt to reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. 
      The da Vinci System has 3 active robotic arms in addition to the camera scope,
      and an extra robotic arm (ERA) is generally used to maintain a fine and stable
      operative field. However, the optimal use of an ERA has not been documented. In
      addition, the learning curve of the RAE using the da Vinci System remains
      controversial. In this study, we aimed to determine the optimal use of an ERA in 
      association with the initial learning curve of robotic McKeown esophagectomy with
      extremely extensive lymphadenectomy. Methods: We reviewed 81 consecutive patients
      who underwent RAE. To determine whether stereotypical use of an ERA after
      establishment of its optimal use accounted for the learning curve, we measured
      the duration of 14 steps and the duration when performed with optimal use of an
      ERA in the corresponding step by reviewing video-recorded procedures. We then
      calculated the ratio as the degree of stereotypical use of the ERA during the da 
      Vinci chest procedures. Results: The cumulative sum method showed that the
      learning curve required 27 cases of RAE. In addition, stereotypical use of the
      ERA was significantly associated with the learning curve of RAE. Conclusions:
      Establishment of optimal use of an ERA could help to accelerate the learning
      curve in da Vinci chest procedures during McKeown esophagectomy with extensive
      lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Copper-Catalyzed Glutathione Oxidation is Accelerated by the Anticancer
      Thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT and Further Boosted at Lower pH.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c05355 [doi]
AB  - Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant thiol in mammalian cells and plays a
      crucial role in maintaining redox cellular homeostasis. The thiols of two GSH
      molecules can be oxidized to the disulfide GSSG. The cytosolic GSH/GSSG ratio is 
      very high (>100), and its reduction can lead to apoptosis or necrosis, which are 
      of interest in cancer research. Cu(II) ions are very efficient oxidants of
      thiols, but with an excess of GSH, Cu(I)n(GS)m clusters are formed, in which
      Cu(I) is very slowly reoxidized by O2 at pH 7.4 and even more slowly at lower pH.
      Here, the aerobic oxidation of GSH by Cu(II) was investigated at different pH
      values in the presence of the anticancer thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT, which
      accumulates in lysosomes and induces lysosomal membrane permeabilization in a
      Cu-dependent manner. The results showed that Cu(II)-Dp44mT catalyzes GSH
      oxidation faster than Cu(II) alone at pH 7.4 and hence accelerates the production
      of very reactive hydroxyl radicals. Moreover, GSH oxidation and hydroxyl radical 
      production by Cu(II)-Dp44mT were accelerated at the acidic pH found in lysosomes.
      To decipher this unusually faster thiol oxidation at lower pH, density functional
      theory (DFT) calculations, electrochemical and spectroscopic studies were
      performed. The results suggest that the acceleration is due to the protonation of
      Cu(II)-Dp44mT on the hydrazinic nitrogen, which favors the rate-limiting
      reduction step without subsequent dissociation of the Cu(I) intermediate.
      Furthermore, preliminary biological studies in cell culture using the proton pump
      inhibitor bafilomycin A1 indicated that the lysosomal pH plays a role in the
      activity of Cu(II)-Dp44mT.

AB  - Biomarkers guiding the neoadjuvant use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICBs) are
      needed for patients with localized muscle invasive bladder cancers (MIBC).
      Profiling tumor and blood samples, we found that follicular helper CD4+ T cells
      (TFH) are among the best therapeutic targets of pembrolizumab correlating with
      progression-free survival. TFH were associated with tumoral CD8 and PD-L1
      expression at baseline, and the induction of tertiary lymphoid structures
      post-pembrolizumab. Blood central memory TFH accumulated in tumors where they
      produce CXCL13, a chemokine found in the plasma of responders only. IgG4+CD38+
      TFH residing in bladder tissues correlated with clinical benefit. Finally, TFH
      and IgG directed against urothelium invasive Escherichia coli dictated clinical
      responses to pembrolizumab in three independent cohorts. The links between tumor 
      infection and success of ICB immunomodulation should be prospectively assessed at
      a larger scale.

TI  - Downregulation of Stem-loop binding protein by nicotine via alpha7-nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptor and its role in nicotine-induced cell transformation.
LID - kfac080 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfac080 [doi]
AB  - The use of electronic-cigarettes (e-cigs) has increased substantially in recent
      years, particularly among the younger generations. Liquid nicotine is the main
      component of e-cigs. Previous studies have shown that mice exposed to e-cig
      aerosols developed lung adenocarcinoma and bladder hyperplasia. These findings
      implicated a potential role for e-cig aerosols and nicotine in cancer
      development, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we
      report that exposure to liquid nicotine or nicotine aerosol generated from e-cig 
      induces downregulation of Stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) and polyadenylation of
      canonical histone mRNAs in human bronchial epithelial cells and in mice lungs.
      Canonical histone mRNAs typically do not end in a poly(A) tail and the
      acquisition of such a tail via depletion of SLBP has been shown to causes
      chromosome instability. We show that nicotine-induced SLBP depletion is reversed 
      by an inhibitor of alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha7-nAChR) or
      siRNA specific for alpha7-nAChR, indicating a nAChR-dependent reduction of SLBP
      by nicotine. Moreover, PI3K/AKT pathway is activated by nicotine exposure and CK2
      and probably CDK1, two kinases well known for their function for SLBP
      phosphorylation and degradation, are shown to be involved,
      alpha7-nAChR-dependently, in nicotine-induced SLBP depletion. Importantly,
      nicotine-induced anchorage-independent cell growth is attenuated by inhibition of
      alpha7-nAChR and is rescued by overexpression of SLBP. We propose that the SLBP
      depletion and polyadenylation of canonical histone mRNAs via activation of
      alpha7-nAChR and a series of downstream signal transduction pathways, are
      critical for nicotine-induced cell transformation and potential carcinogenesis.

TI  - Discovery of non-autonomous modulators of activated Ras.
LID - jkac200 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkac200 [doi]
AB  - Communication between mesodermal cells and epithelial cells is fundamental to
      normal animal development and is frequently disrupted in cancer. However, the
      genes and processes that mediate this communication are incompletely understood. 
      To identify genes that mediate this communication and alter the proliferation of 
      cells with an oncogenic Ras genotype, we carried out a tissue-specific
      genome-wide RNAi screen in C. elegans animals bearing a let-60(n1046gf) (RasG13E)
      allele. The screen identifies 24 genes that, when knocked down in adjacent
      mesodermal tissue, suppress the increased vulval epithelial cell proliferation
      defect associated with let-60(n1046gf). Importantly, gene knockdown reverts the
      mutant animals to a wild-type phenotype. Using chimeric animals, we genetically
      confirm that two of the genes function non-autonomously to revert the
      let-60(n1046gf) phenotype. The effect is genotype-restricted, as knockdown does
      not alter development in a wild type (let-60(+)) or activated EGF receptor
      (let-23(sa62gf)) background. Although many of the genes identified encode
      proteins involved in essential cellular processes including chromatin formation, 
      ribosome function and mitochondrial ATP metabolism, knockdown does not alter the 
      normal development or function of targeted mesodermal tissues, indicating that
      the phenotype derives from specific functions performed by these cells. We show
      that the genes act in a manner distinct from two signal ligand classes (EGF and
      Wnt) known to influence the development of vulval epithelial cells. Altogether,
      the results identify genes with a novel function in mesodermal cells required for
      communicating with and promoting the proliferation of adjacent epithelial cells
      with an activated Ras genotype.

TI  - DBFE: Distribution-based feature extraction from structural variants in
      whole-genome data.
LID - btac513 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac513 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Whole-genome sequencing has revolutionized biosciences by providing
      tools for constructing complete DNA sequences of individuals. With entire genomes
      at hand, scientists can pinpoint DNA fragments responsible for oncogenesis and
      predict patient responses to cancer treatments. Machine learning plays a
      paramount role in this process. However, the sheer volume of whole-genome data
      makes it difficult to encode the characteristics of genomic variants as features 
      for learning algorithms. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose three feature
      extraction methods that facilitate classifier learning from sets of genomic
      variants. The core contributions of this work include: (1) strategies for
      determining features using variant length binning, clustering, and density
      estimation; (2) a programming library for automating distribution-based feature
      extraction in machine learning pipelines. The proposed methods have been
      validated on five real-world datasets using four different classification
      algorithms and a clustering approach. Experiments on genomes of 219 ovarian, 61
      lung, and 929 breast cancer patients show that the proposed approaches
      automatically identify genomic biomarkers associated with cancer subtypes and
      clinical response to oncological treatment. Finally, we show that the extracted
      features can be used alongside unsupervised learning methods to analyze genomic
      samples. AVAILABILITY: The source code of the presented algorithms and
      reproducible experimental scripts are available on Github at
      https://github.com/MNMdiagnostics/dbfe.

      studies.
LID - djac149 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djac149 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies suggested associations between the oral microbiome
      and lung cancer, but studies were predominantly cross-sectional and underpowered.
      METHODS: Using a case-cohort design, 1,306 incident lung cancer cases were
      identified in the Agricultural Health Study, NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, and 
      Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Referent
      subcohorts were randomly selected by strata of age, sex, and smoking history. DNA
      was extracted from oral wash specimens using the DSP DNA Virus Pathogen kit, the 
      16S rRNA gene V4 region was amplified and sequenced, and bioinformatics were
      conducted using QIIME 2. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
      were calculated using weighted Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Higher
      alpha diversity was associated with lower lung cancer risk (Shannon index HR
      0.90; 95% CI: 0.84-0.96). Specific principal component vectors of the microbial
      communities were also significantly associated with lung cancer risk. After
      multiple testing adjustment, greater relative abundance of three genera and
      presence of one genus were associated with greater lung cancer risk, while
      presence of three genera were associated with lower risk. For example, every
      standard deviation increase in Streptococcus abundance was associated with 1.14
      times the risk of lung cancer (95% CI: 1.06-1.22). Associations were strongest
      among squamous cell carcinoma cases and former smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple
      oral microbial measures were prospectively associated with lung cancer risk in
      three US cohort studies with associations varying by smoking history and
      histologic subtype. The oral microbiome may offer new opportunities for lung
      cancer prevention.

LID - 10.1002/prp2.993 [doi]
AB  - We recently described the identification of a new class of small-molecule
      activators of the mitochondrial protease ClpP. These compounds synthesized by
      Madera Therapeutics showed increased potency of cancer growth inhibition over the
      related compound ONC201. In this study, we describe chemical optimization and
      characterization of the next generation of highly potent and selective
      small-molecule ClpP activators (TR compounds) and demonstrate their efficacy
      against breast cancer models in vitro and in vivo. We selected one compound
      (TR-107) with excellent potency, specificity, and drug-like properties for
      further evaluation. TR-107 showed ClpP-dependent growth inhibition in the low
      nanomolar range that was equipotent to paclitaxel in triple-negative breast
      cancer (TNBC) cell models. TR-107 also reduced specific mitochondrial proteins,
      including OXPHOS and TCA cycle components, in a time-, dose-, and ClpP-dependent 
      manner. Seahorse XF analysis and glucose deprivation experiments confirmed the
      inactivation of OXPHOS and increased dependence on glycolysis following TR-107
      exposure. The pharmacokinetic properties of TR-107 were compared with other known
      ClpP activators including ONC201 and ONC212. TR-107 displayed excellent exposure 
      and serum t1/2 after oral administration. Using human TNBC MDA-MB-231 xenografts,
      the antitumor response to TR-107 was investigated. Oral administration of TR-107 
      resulted in a reduction in tumor volume and extension of survival in the treated 
      compared with vehicle control mice. ClpP activation in vivo was validated by
      immunoblotting for TFAM and other mitochondrial proteins. In summary, we describe
      the identification of highly potent new ClpP agonists with improved efficacy
      against TNBC, through targeted inactivation of OXPHOS and disruption of
      mitochondrial metabolism.

      prognostic marker studies by cytology.
LID - 10.1002/dc.25028 [doi]
AB  - Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is an infrequent, but aggressive fatal subtype of
      thyroid cancer. The osteoclastic variant of anaplastic carcinoma is a rare
      subtype of anaplastic carcinoma with rare cases reported in the literature.
      Molecular targeted therapies have emerged for the anaplastic carcinoma,
      necessitating accurate pathologic diagnosis with additional ancillary testing for
      directing clinical management. We present here the cytological diagnosis of an
      anaplastic thyroid carcinoma-osteoclastic variant on fine-needle aspiration
      (FNA), with emphasis on the novelty of utilizing the least invasive procedure
      (aspiration cytology) for rendering pathological diagnosis as well as identifying
      potential prognostic markers for targeted immunotherapy.

TI  - Cytomorphology of spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma, including MYOD1
      (LI22R) mutation result.
LID - 10.1002/dc.25032 [doi]
AB  - Spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), characterized by MYOD1 (L122R)
      mutation in a subset of cases is a newly described subtype of RMS. Presently,
      there is no documentation of cytomorphological features, especially of sclerosing
      RMS. Case 1: A 24-year-old male presented with pain and swelling in his wrist for
      a one-year duration. MRI revealed a well-defined soft tissue lesion measuring 5.3
      cm, encasing the lower end of the ulna. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)
      smears revealed clusters of tumor cells with round to oval to spindle-shaped
      nuclei, scant to moderate amount of cytoplasm with the wisps of the metachromatic
      stroma. Histopathological examination revealed a malignant tumor comprising cells
      with polygonal to spindle-shaped nuclei, arranged in a sclerotic stroma.
      Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for desmin, myogenin, and
      MYOD1. A diagnosis of sclerosing RMS was offered. Furthermore, the tumor revealed
      MYOD1 (L122R) mutation. Case 2: A 43-year-old male presented with a 4-month
      history of "nasal stuffiness" and pressure. Imaging revealed a poorly defined
      infiltrative lesion in his nasal cavity. FNAC smears revealed loose and tightly
      cohesive clusters of malignant cells with oval to spindle-shaped nuclei, a
      moderate amount of ill-defined bluish to finely vacuolated cytoplasm, and focal
      streak artifact with interspersed stromal fragments. Histopathological
      examination revealed a malignant tumor composed of oval to spindle-shaped nuclei,
      embedded in a variably hyalinized stroma. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells 
      were positive for desmin, and myogenin. Diagnosis of spindle cell/sclerosing RMS 
      was offered. The present study constitutes one of the first documentation of
      cytomorphological features of two rare cases of spindle cell/sclerosing RMS. The 
      differential diagnoses and treatment-related implications are presented.

TI  - Clinical spectrum of rectal cancer identifies hallmarks of early-onset patients
      and next-generation treatment strategies.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer is increasing among young adults
      and more rectal cancers are reported. This study aimed to identify the clinical
      features specific for early-onset rectal cancer and provide insights on cancer
      management. METHODS: Early-onset (<50 years) and late-onset (>/=50 years) rectal 
      cancer patients from a referral tertiary care center (SYSU cohort) and
      Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database (SEER cohort) were included to
      perform a comprehensive comparison on clinical information. RESULTS: A total of
      552 and 80,341 patients with stages I-III rectal cancer were included in the SYSU
      and SEER cohorts, respectively. In the SYSU cohort, early-onset diseases had
      significantly higher prevalence of family history of cancer and history of HBV
      infection and lower incidence of comorbidities (p < 0.05). In addition,
      early-onset patients presented more frequently with advanced node stage (N2
      stage: 16.9 vs. 9.3%, p = 0.017) and high-risk features, including mucinous or
      signet cell carcinomas (21.8 vs. 12.9%, p = 0.014), poorly differentiated tumors 
      (28.8 vs. 15.4%, p = 0.002), and perineural invasion (14.5 vs. 7.9%, p = 0.027)
      compared with late-onset patients. However, early-onset patients received more
      neoadjuvant (18.5 vs. 11.2%, p = 0.032) and adjuvant treatments (71.0 vs. 45.8%, 
      p < 0.001), and they had better overall survival in both SYSU (HR 0.57, 95% CI:
      0.34-0.95; p = 0.029) and SEER (HR 0.38, 95% CI: 0.37-0.40; p < 0.001) cohorts.
      CONCLUSION: Early-onset rectal cancers are distinct from late-onset cases in
      clinicopathological features, treatment modalities, and outcomes. The clinical
      trials and studies that are specific for young populations are needed to develop 
      optimal strategies for cancer screening, treatment, and surveillance.

TI  - Prognostic role of targeted methylation analysis in paraffin-embedded samples of 
      adrenocortical carcinoma.
LID - dgac470 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgac470 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare aggressive disease with
      heterogeneous prognosis. Previous studies identified hypermethylation in the
      promoter region of specific genes to be associated with poor clinical outcome.
      OBJECTIVE: Comparative analysis of promising hypermethylated genes as prognostic 
      markers and evaluation of their added value to established clinical prognostic
      tools. DESIGN: We included 237 patients with ACCs. Tumor DNA was isolated from
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Targeted pyrosequencing was used
      to detect promoter region methylation in 5 preselected genes (PAX5, GSTP1,
      PYCARD, PAX6, G0S2). The prognostic role of hypermethylation pattern was compared
      to S-GRAS score. Primary endpoints were progression-free (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS), with disease-free (DFS) as secondary endpoint. RESULTS: 27.9%,
      13.9%, 49%, 49% and 25.3% of cases showed hypermethylation in PAX5, GSTP1,
      PYCARD, PAX6, and G0S2, respectively. Hypermethylation in all individual genes - 
      except GSTP1 - was significantly associated with both PFS and OS - with Hazard
      Ratios (HR) between 1.4 and 2.3. However, only hypermethylation of PAX5 remained 
      significantly associated with OS (p=0.013; HR=1.95, 95%CI 1.2-3.3) in
      multivariable analysis. A model for risk stratification was developed, combining 
      PAX5 methylation status and S-GRAS groups, showing improved prognostic
      performance compared to S-GRAS alone (Harrell's C index: OS=0.751, PFS=0.711,
      DFS=0.688). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that hypermethylation in PAX5 is
      associated with worst clinical outcome in ACC, even after accounting for S-GRAS
      score. Assessing methylation in FFPE material is straightforward in the clinical 
      setting and could be used to improve accuracy of prognostic classification,
      enabling the direction of personalized management.

      Disease Diagnosis.
LID - izac171 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ibd/izac171 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We compared risks of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) and melanoma
      preceding and following a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to
      evaluate the effect of thiopurines and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (anti-TNF-alpha) on skin cancer risk in IBD. METHODS: This was a retrospective,
      historical cohort study using the population-based University of Manitoba IBD
      Epidemiology Database (11 228 IBD cases and 104 725 matched controls) linked to
      the Manitoba Cancer Registry. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed
      to calculate skin cancer risks prior to and after IBD diagnosis. RESULTS: Persons
      with ulcerative colitis (UC) were more likely to have basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 
      predating their UC diagnosis (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.08-1.60). Risks of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), other NMSCs, or melanoma
      prior to IBD diagnosis were not significantly increased. Post-IBD diagnosis,
      risks of BCC (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.37-1.70) and SCC (hazard ratio, 1.61;
      95% CI, 1.29-2.01) were significantly increased across all IBD groups except for 
      SCC in UC. There was no significant association between melanoma and IBD post-IBD
      diagnosis. The risks of BCC and melanoma were increased in thiopurine and
      anti-TNF users, and risk of SCC was increased in only thiopurine users. Nested
      cohort analysis of persons with IBD with censoring at both thiopurines and
      anti-TNF use confirmed a higher baseline risk of BCC and no effect on SCC,
      comparable to pre-IBD diagnosis findings. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of BCC preceding 
      a diagnosis of UC is higher than in non-UC controls, compared with a generally
      increased risk of all NMSCs post-IBD diagnosis. Thiopurine and anti-TNF therapy
      increase the risks for skin cancers in persons with IBD after their diagnoses.

TI  - Spectrum of Germline Mutations Within Fanconi Anemia-Associated Genes Across
      Populations of Varying Ancestry.
LID - pkaa117 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jncics/pkaa117 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder associated with
      hematological disorders and solid tumor predisposition. Owing to phenotypic
      heterogeneity, some patients remain undetected until adulthood, usually following
      cancer diagnoses. The uneven prevalence of FA cases with different underlying FA 
      gene mutations worldwide suggests variable genetic distribution across
      populations. Here, we aim to assess the genetic spectrum of FA-associated genes
      across populations of varying ancestries and explore potential genotype-phenotype
      associations in cancer. METHODS: Carrier frequency and variant spectrum of
      potentially pathogenic germline variants in 17 FA genes (excluding BRCA1/FANCS,
      BRCA2/FANCD1, BRIP1/FANCJ, PALB2/FANCN, RAD51C/FANCO) were evaluated in 3523
      Singaporeans and 7 populations encompassing Asian, European, African, and admixed
      ancestries from the Genome Aggregation Database. Germline and somatic variants of
      17 FA genes in 7 cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas were assessed to
      explore genotype-phenotype associations. RESULTS: Germline variants in FANCA were
      consistently more frequent in all populations. Similar trends in carrier
      frequency and variant spectrum were detected in Singaporeans and East Asians,
      both distinct from other ancestry groups, particularly in the lack of recurrent
      variants. Our exploration of The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset suggested higher
      germline and somatic mutation burden between FANCA and FANCC with head and neck
      and lung squamous cell carcinomas as well as FANCI and SLX4/FANCP with uterine
      cancer, but the analysis was insufficiently powered to detect any statistical
      significance. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the diverse genetic spectrum of 
      FA-associated genes across populations of varying ancestries, emphasizing the
      need to include all known FA-related genes for accurate molecular diagnosis of
      FA.

TI  - Serine racemase expression differentiates aging from Alzheimer's brain.
LID - 10.2174/1567205019666220805105106 [doi]
AB  - Aging is an inevitable process characterized with progressive loss of
      physiological integrity and increased susceptibility to cancer, diabetes,
      cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases; regarding the last, aging is the 
      primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of
      dementia. AD is characterized by brain pathology including extracellular
      deposition of amyloid aggregation and intracellular accumulation of
      neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. In addition,
      losses of synapses and a wide range of neurons are pivotal pathologies in AD
      brain. Accumulating evidence demonstrates hypoactivation of hippocampal neural
      networks in the aging brain, whereas AD-related mild cognitive impairment
      (AD-MCI) is begins with hyperactivation, followed by diminution of hippocampal
      activity as AD develops. The biphasic trends of the activity of hippocampal
      neural network are consistent with the alteration of N-methyl-D-aspartate
      receptor (NMDA-R) activity from aging to prodromal (AD-MCI) to mid-/late stage
      AD. D-Serine, a product of racemization catalyzed by serine racemase (SR), is an 
      important co-agonist of the NMDA-R which is involved in synaptic events including
      neurotransmission, synaptogenesis, long-term potentiation (LTP), development, and
      excitotoxicity. SR and D-serine are decreased in the hippocampus of the aging
      brain, correlating with impairment of cognitive function. By contrast, SR is
      increased in AD brain, which is associated with a greater degree of cognitive
      dysfunction. Emerging studies suggest that D-serine levels in the brain or in
      cerebral spinal fluid from AD patients are higher than in age-matched controls,
      but the results are inconsistent. Very recently, serum D-serine levels in AD were
      reported to correlate with sex and clinical dementia rating (CDR) stage. This
      review will discuss alterations of NMDA-R and SR in aging and brain, and the
      mechanisms underlying the differential regulation of SR will be probed.
      Collectively, we propose that SR may be a molecular switch that distinguishes the
      effects of aging from those of AD on the brain.

TI  - Small Molecule-based Supramolecular Plastics Mediated by Liquid-Liquid Phase
      Separation.
LID - 10.1002/anie.202204611 [doi]
AB  - Plastics are one of the most widely used polymeric materials. However, they are
      often undegradable and non-recyclable due to the very stable covalent bonds of
      macromolecules, causing environmental pollution and health problems. Here, we
      report that liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) could drive the formation of
      robust, stable, and sustainable plastics using small molecules. The LLPS process 
      could sequester and concentrate solutes, strengthen the non-covalent association 
      between molecules and produce a bulk material whose property was highly related
      to the encapsulated water amounts. It was a robust plastic with a remarkable
      Young's modulus of 139.5 MPa when the water content was low while became adhesive
      and could instantly self-heal with more absorbed water. Finally, responsiveness
      enabled the material highly recyclable. This work allowed us to understand the
      LLPS at the molecular level and demonstrated that LLPS is a promising approach to
      exploring eco-friendly supramolecular plastics that are potential substitutes for
      conventional polymers.

PG  - 33-38
LID - 10.46439/cancerbiology.2.020 [doi]
AB  - In the United States, lung and bronchus cancers are the second most common types 
      of cancer and are responsible for the largest number of deaths from cancer, with 
      African Americans suffering disproportionately from lung and bronchus cancers.
      This disparity likely results from a complex interplay among social,
      psycho-social, lifestyle, environmental, health system, and biological
      determinants of health. Toward improving outcomes for lung cancer patients of all
      races and ethnicities and mitigating lung cancer disparities, in this commentary,
      we bring forward biological factors that contribute to lung cancer disparities,
      efforts to identify, functionally characterize, and modulate novel
      ancestry-related RNA splicing-related targets in lung cancer for precision
      intervention, and translational and clinical research needs to improve outcomes
      for lung cancer patients of all races and ethnicities and mitigate lung cancer
      disparities.

      improve chemotherapy.
LID - BST20220162 [pii]
LID - 10.1042/BST20220162 [doi]
AB  - The dense desmoplastic and fibrotic stroma is a characteristic feature of
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), regulating disease progression,
      metastasis and response to treatment. Reciprocal interactions between the tumour 
      and stroma are mediated by bidirectional integrin-mediated signalling, in
      particular by Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK). FAK is often hyperactivated and
      overexpressed in aggressive cancers, promoting stromal remodelling and inducing
      tissue stiffness which can accelerate cancer cell proliferation, survival and
      chemoresistance. Therapeutic targeting of the PDAC stroma is an evolving area of 
      interest for pre-clinical and clinical research, where a subtle reshaping of the 
      stromal architecture prior to chemotherapy may prove promising in the clinical
      management of disease and overall patient survival. Here, we describe how
      transient stromal manipulation (or 'priming') via short-term FAK inhibition,
      rather than chronic treatment, can render PDAC cells exquisitely vulnerable to
      subsequent standard-of-care chemotherapy. We assess how our priming publication
      fits with the recent literature and describe in this perspective how this could
      impact future cancer treatment. This highlights the significance of treatment
      timing and warrants further consideration of anti-fibrotic therapies in the
      clinical management of PDAC and other fibrotic diseases.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of complement-associated molecular features in
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
LID - 10.3724/abbs.2022097 [doi]
AB  - The complement cascade plays a "complementing" role in human immunity. However,
      the potential roles of complement system in impacting molecular and clinical
      features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In this study, eleven 
      public datasets are analyzed to compare the complement status between normal and 
      cancerous samples based on 18 classical complement-associated genes. The
      complement scores are constructed to quantify complement signatures of individual
      tumors. HCC patients in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort are focused to 
      perform systematical analyses between complement status and immune infiltration, 
      miRNA expression, DNA methylation, clinicopathological features, and drug
      response. The results show that the complement scores in normal tissues are
      dramatically higher than those of tumor tissues. Tumor samples in the TCGA cohort
      are classified into complement score-low and score-high groups. Pathway analysis 
      reveals that tumor-promoting pathways are typically inhibited in complement
      score-high group. This study also shows that tumor-killing immune cells, such as 
      CD8 T cells and natural killer cells are abundant and tumor-suppressing miRNAs
      are upregulated in complement score-high samples. In addition, we identify that
      complement scores are negatively correlated with certain clinical features,
      including pathological grade, clinical-stage, and portal vein invasion. Moreover,
      various molecular features together with complement scores are found to be
      correlated with response to anti-cancer drugs. This study provides a
      comprehensive and multidimensional analysis conducive to understanding the role
      of complement in cancer.

TI  - Do breast cancer survivors with a recent history of clinical depression report
      worse experiences with care? A retrospective cohort study using SEER-CAHPS data.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5031 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We examined whether breast cancer survivors' experiences with care
      differed by a recent history of clinical depression, and whether associations
      differed by race/ethnicity. METHODS: Using the Epidemiology and End
      Results-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (SEER-CAHPS)
      dataset, we analyzed records of breast cancer survivors who completed a survey at
      least 12 months after their cancer diagnosis. We assessed clinical depression 12 
      months prior to survey completion using Medicare claims. We used separate
      multivariable logistic regressions to examine the associations between depression
      and excellent (vs. less than excellent) ratings of experiences with care (i.e.,
      doctor communication, getting needed care, getting care quickly, getting
      prescription drugs, specialist and overall care). We also assessed interactions
      of depression by race/ethnicity. All models were adjusted for demographics and
      cancer prognostic and treatment factors. RESULTS: Of the 2271 survivors, 7.6%
      were clinically depressed. After adjusting for covariates, survivors with
      clinical depression had lower odds of reporting excellent ratings of their
      ability to get needed care, care by their specialist, and overall care, compared 
      to those without depression (AOR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.40-0.84; AOR = 0.40, CI:
      0.31-0.76; and AOR = 0.61, CI: 0.42-0.89, respectively). Among Hispanics, having 
      depression was associated with higher odds of excellent ratings of one's ability 
      to get needed care (AOR: 5.42, 95% CI: 1.02-28.81). No other statistically
      significant associations by race/ethnicity were found. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer
      survivors with depression report poorer patient experiences with care. Further
      research is needed to understand complexities of ratings of experiences with care
      among survivors of diverse backgrounds. IMPLICATIONS: Survivors with a recent
      history of clinical depression may benefit from additional supportive care
      services.

TI  - Assisted reproductive technology and association with childhood cancer subtypes.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5114 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between assisted reproductive
      technology (ART) use and childhood cancer subtype. STUDY DESIGN: We deployed a
      cross-sectional survey of 1701 parents of children with cancer about their ART
      use, demographics, and gestational and perinatal factors. Multivariable logistic 
      regression modeled the association between ART use, birthweight and multiple
      gestation status with childhood cancer, by subtype. RESULTS: ART use was highest 
      among children with osteosarcoma relative to children with other cancer types,
      and this association was statistically significant in multivariable models (OR = 
      4.4; 95% CI = 1.7-11.3; p = 0.0020). ART use was also elevated among children
      with hepatoblastoma, but this relationship appeared to be due to the strong
      associations between ART use and lower birthweight in our sample. No specific ART
      modality appeared to drive these associations. In univariate models, multiple
      gestation was associated with a 2.7-fold increased odds of hepatoblastoma (OR =
      2.71; 95% CI = 1.14-6.42; p = 0.02) and a 1.6-fold increased odds of
      neuroblastoma (OR = 1.62; 95% CI = 1.03-2.54; p = 0.03), but these associations
      were not retained in multivariable models. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between ART 
      use and hepatoblastoma risk may be attributable to birthweight, a known
      hepatoblastoma risk factor. ART use may also be associated with osteosarcoma,
      independent of birthweight, an association not previously observed in studies
      limited to cancers diagnosed before adolescence. Evaluating long-term health
      outcomes in children conceived by ART, throughout adolescence and potentially
      into adulthood, appears warranted.

PG  - 174-179
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000608 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Oral pain is a common complaint in patients with cancer. This 
      review aims to summarize the knowledge on the causes and approach to management
      of oral pain garnered over the past 2 years. RECENT FINDINGS: A systematic review
      and meta-analysis included in the review, assessed cannabinoid versus placebo and
      showed only a small effect on pain, physical function, and sleep quality. Another
      review showed that chemical neurolysis as an adjunctive therapy, is effective in 
      patients with pain of shorter chronicity and refractory head and neck
      cancer-related pain. SUMMARY: Patients with cancer frequently experience oral
      pain because of a variety of factors. Factors inherent in the type and location
      of the malignancy, the modality of cancer treatment, and a holistic approach to
      management together contribute to their overall pain experience. Basic oral care 
      should be implemented wherever possible, before, during, and after cancer
      treatment.

      impact on gastrointestinal toxicities during cancer treatment.
PG  - 168-173
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000604 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a global pandemic, with people with other conditions
      at greater risk of severe infection with intensified symptoms across multiple
      organ systems. Patients with cancer are at greater risk, and it is likely that
      those receiving treatment will experience greater incidence and severity of
      gastrointestinal toxicities, such as gastrointestinal mucositis, due to
      SARS-CoV-2 binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 in the intestine.
      RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 patients experience
      gastrointestinal toxicities, and SARS-CoV-2 has capacity to infect intestinal
      cells through binding to ACE2 expressed in the intestine. ACE2 has a key role in 
      intestinal homeostasis, and as such there is a concern for the impact of
      SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 in terms of the implications for cancer
      treatment-induced gastrointestinal toxicities. SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 is a high-risk
      infection for cancer patients receiving treatment. It is important to understand 
      the mechanisms of intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 to determine the effect of
      SARS-CoV-2 infections on gastrointestinal toxicities, such as mucositis.

TI  - Using real world data to advance the provision of supportive cancer care:
      mucositis as a case study.
PG  - 161-167
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000600 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: For decades, clinical decision making and practice has been
      largely informed by data generated through randomized clinical trials (RCTs). By 
      design, RCTs are highly restricted in both scope and scale, resulting in narrow
      indications and iterative advances in clinical practice. With the transition to
      electronic health records, there are now endless opportunities to utilize these
      'real world' data (RWD) to make more substantive advances in our understanding
      that are, by nature, more applicable to reality. This review discusses the
      current paradigm of using big data to advance and inform the provision of
      supportive cancer care, using mucositis as a case study. RECENT FINDINGS: Global 
      efforts to synthesize RWD in cancer have almost exclusively focused on tumor
      classification and treatment efficacy, leveraging on routine tumor pathology and 
      binary response outcomes. In contrast, clinical notes and billing codes are not
      as applicable to treatment side effects which require integration of both
      clinical and biological data, as well as patient-reported outcomes. SUMMARY:
      Cancer treatment-induced toxicities are heterogeneous and complex, and as such,
      the use of RWD to better understand their etiology and interaction is
      challenging. Multidisciplinary cooperation and leadership are needed to improve
      data collection and governance to ensure the right data is accessible and
      reliable.

TI  - Healthcare provider experiences during COVID-19 redeployment.
PG  - 144-150
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000609 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Among the myriad traumatic impacts of COVID-19, the need for
      redeployment served as a significant stressor for healthcare providers (HCPs).
      This narrative review summarizes the current literature on HCP redeployment
      experiences and institutional support for staff, while proposing a theoretical
      approach to mitigating the negative impact on HCP mental health. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Redeployment was a strong predictor of negative emotions in HCP during the
      initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas reflections on benefit-finding
      associated with redeployment were reported more frequently during later stages.
      In institutions where attention to redeployment impact was addressed and
      effective strategies put in place, redeployed HCP felt they received adequate
      training and support and felt satisfied with the information provided.
      Redeployment had the potential to yield personal feelings of accomplishment,
      situational leadership, meaning, and increased sense of team connectedness.
      SUMMARY: Benefit-finding, or posttraumatic growth, is a concept in cancer
      psychiatry which speaks to construing benefits from adversity to support
      resilience. Redeployment experiences can result in unexpected benefit-finding for
      individual HCPs. Taking a benefit-finding, relational, and existentially informed
      approach to COVID-19 redeployment might serve as an opportunity for posttraumatic
      growth for both individuals and institutions.

      patients.
PG  - 138-143
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000614 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the current literature on the psychological
      impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer, both in terms of the impact of the
      virus itself and of changes in the healthcare system; and to describe current
      recommendations for supporting patients with cancer during the pandemic. RECENT
      FINDINGS: Multiple studies have shown that patients with cancer experience high
      levels of psychological distress during COVID-19. Factors of greater
      vulnerability have been described as: being young, being female, low
      socioeconomic status, lower educational level, having low levels of hope or
      optimism, lower social support, and having cancer with curative intent. The
      severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2pandemic has accelerated the
      healthcare digitization process. All departments involved in the diagnosis and
      treatment of cancer have made contingency plans to minimize the impact on
      patients. SUMMARY: Psychological distress is one of the most frequently occurring
      symptoms in patients with cancer during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has
      led to a restructuring of the healthcare system. The paradigm shift may pose a
      challenge for both healthcare professionals and patients.

PG  - 117-122
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000605 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The COVID-19 pandemic posed several challenges to cancer
      research including halting of trials, reduced recruitment and protocol violations
      related to inflexible processes followed in clinical trials. Researchers adopted 
      innovative measures to mitigate these problems and continue studies without
      compromising their quality. This review collates these adaptations that could
      well continue after the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: The COVID-19 pandemic forced
      researchers globally to adopt innovative measures to overcome the challenges of
      the pandemic. These included protocol amendments to adjust to the pandemic and
      travel restrictions, and increased use of digital technologies. 'Virtual'
      clinical trials were conducted increasingly with adaptations in ethics and
      regulatory approvals, patient recruitment and consenting, study interventions and
      delivery of study medications, trial assessments, and monitoring. Many of these
      adaptations are safe and feasible, without compromising study quality and data
      integrity. Although these may not be universally applicable in all types of
      research, they bring many benefits including more diverse patient participation, 
      less burden on patients for study procedures and reduced resources to conduct
      trials. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected cancer research adversely;
      however, learnings from the pandemic and adaptations from researchers are likely 
      to improve the efficiency of clinical research beyond the pandemic.

      Europe.
PG  - 110-116
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000601 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Over the past 2 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has had
      short-term and long-term effects on the delivery of cancer care. Some European
      countries faced an unprecedented widespread crisis during the first year of the
      SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, only being able afterwards to gradually recover, thanks to
      the improvement in preventive measures, changes in public health and reactive
      processes in cancer care and a better understanding of the ongoing heath
      emergency. RECENT FINDINGS: The development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and COVID-19
      specific treatments, the growing testing and tracking capability to limit virus
      diffusion, and research efforts to better define areas of action have all greatly
      limited the negative impact of the health emergency on routine cancer care.The
      need to protect those more vulnerable and to ensure continuity of care for
      oncology patients has been balanced across the pandemic, with the aim to
      guarantee an optimal standard of care. SUMMARY: This article aims to provide an
      overview on the evolving scenario of cancer care throughout the COVID-19 pandemic
      in Europe, focusing on the particular features that characterized the pandemic
      course as well as the main differences that were observed across it.

      oncology nursing: a rapid review.
PG  - 94-101
LID - 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000603 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A rapid review was conducted to synthesize evidence of
      palliative care delivery changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes were
      synthesized according to the eight domains of high-quality palliative care and
      enduring implications for oncology nurses beyond the pandemic discussed. RECENT
      FINDINGS: The most significant changes occurred in the structure and processes of
      palliative care (Domain 1), where increased utilization of telehealth was
      critical in circumventing barriers imposed by COVID-19 mitigation. The suboptimal
      availability of community-based psychosocial supports for patients and caregivers
      and inadequate health system-based psychosocial supports for healthcare providers
      were highlighted (Domains 3-5). The pandemic also ushered in an increased
      emphasis on the need for advance care planning (ACP), where integrating its
      delivery earlier in the outpatient setting and shifting policy to promote
      subsequent virtual documentation (Domain 8) were essential to ensure care
      preferences were clarified and accessible before health crises occurred. SUMMARY:
      Continuing to embrace and sustain systems-level changes with respect to
      telehealth, psychosocial supports, and ACP are critical to bridging gaps in
      palliative care delivery underscored by the pandemic. Oncology nurses are well
      positioned to fill these gaps in care beyond the pandemic by providing
      evidence-based, palliative care throughout the cancer continuum.

LID - jcs259676 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jcs.259676 [doi]
AB  - Quiescence, the ability to temporarily halt proliferation, is a conserved process
      that initially allowed survival of unicellular organisms during inhospitable
      times and later contributed to the rise of multicellular organisms, becoming key 
      for cell differentiation, size control and tissue homeostasis. In this Review, we
      explore the concept of cancer as a disease that involves abnormal regulation of
      cellular quiescence at every step, from malignant transformation to metastatic
      outgrowth. Indeed, disrupted quiescence regulation can be linked to each of the
      so-called 'hallmarks of cancer'. As we argue here, quiescence induction
      contributes to immune evasion and resistance against cell death. In contrast,
      loss of quiescence underlies sustained proliferative signalling, evasion of
      growth suppressors, pro-tumorigenic inflammation, angiogenesis and genomic
      instability. Finally, both acquisition and loss of quiescence are involved in
      replicative immortality, metastasis and deregulated cellular energetics. We
      believe that a viewpoint that considers quiescence abnormalities that occur
      during oncogenesis might change the way we ask fundamental questions and the
      experimental approaches we take, potentially contributing to novel discoveries
      that might help to alter the course of cancer therapy.

TI  - Circ_0000467 regulates proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in
      gastric cancer by targeting the miR-622/ROCK2 axis.
PG  - 18508
LID - 10.14670/HH-18-508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GC) ranks fourth as a cause of cancer-induced
      mortality worldwide. Recently, some studies have demonstrated that circular RNAs 
      (circRNAs) play vital roles in human cancers, including GC. METHODS: The
      expression levels of circ_0000467, microRNA-622 (miR-622), and Rho-associated
      coiled-coil-containing protein kinase2 (ROCK2) were determined by RT-qPCR assay. 
      The protein expression was quantified by western blot assay. The interaction
      relationship between miR-622 and circ_0000467 or ROCK2 was confirmed by
      dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay. The biological behaviors of GC
      cells including proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were determined
      by EdU assay, colony-forming assay, flow cytometry, and transwell assay. The
      effects of circ_0000467 silencing in vivo were assessed by a xenograft experiment
      in nude mice. RESULTS: MiR-622 was downregulated and ROCK2 was upregulated in GC 
      tissues and cells. Loss-of-function experiment revealed that overexpression of
      miR-622 decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion while it increased
      apoptosis in GC cells. Furthermore, ROCK2 was a functional target of miR-622, and
      upregulation of ROCK2 abolished miR-622-induced effects on GC cells. What's more,
      circ_0000467 was upregulated in GC, and inhibition of miR-622 reversed silencing 
      of circ_0000467-caused effects on GC cells, suggesting that miR-622 was a target 
      of circ_0000467. The suppression of circ_0000467 was able to slow the tumor
      growth in vivo. CONCLUSION: Mechanistically, circ_0000467 functioned as an
      oncogenic regulator in GC by specifically binding to miR-622 to upregulate ROCK2,
      which might be novel diagnostic markers for GC.

TI  - Long noncoding RNA 01614 hyperactivates WNT/betacatenin signaling to promote
      pancreatic cancer progression by suppressing GSK3beta.
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5406 [doi]
LID - 116 [pii]
AB  - Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal type of cancer for which effective therapies
      are limited. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent a critical type of regulator
      category, mediating the tumorigenesis and development of various tumor types,
      including PC. However, the expression patterns and functions of numerous lncRNAs 
      in PC remain poorly understood. In the present study, linc01614 was identified as
      a PCrelated lncRNA. linc01614 was notably upregulated in PC tissues and cell
      lines and was associated with the poor diseasefree survival of patients with PC
      according to the analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlasderived datasets.
      Functionally, linc01614 knockdown suppressed PC cell proliferation, migration and
      invasion in vitro, and inhibited tumor proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
      Mechanistically, linc01614 overexpression stabilized the level of betacatenin
      protein to hyperactivate the WNT/betacatenin signaling pathway in PC cells.
      Further analyses revealed that linc01614 bound to GSK3beta and perturbed the
      interaction between GSK3beta and AXIN1, thereby preventing the formation of the
      betacatenin degradation complex and reducing the degradation of betacatenin. In
      summary, the present findings reveal that linc01614 may function as an oncogene
      and promote the progression of PC and may thus be considered as a potential
      therapeutic target in the future.

TI  - How I Diagnose Mature T-Cell Proliferations by Flow Cytometry.
LID - aqac079 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajcp/aqac079 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mature T-cell neoplasms are a challenging area of diagnostic
      hematopathology. Flow cytometry has emerged as a useful technique for T-cell
      assessment. METHODS: We discuss the application of flow cytometry to the
      evaluation of mature T-cell proliferations, to include illustrative cases,
      theoretical framework, detailed review of normal and reactive T-cell subsets, and
      examination of diagnostic pitfalls. RESULTS: Immunophenotypic aberrancy can be
      construed as a direct expression of the neoplastic phenotype, in contrast to
      clonal expansion, which is seen in reactive and neoplastic T-cell proliferations.
      Major and minor T-cell subsets show characteristic patterns of antigen
      expression. Reactive states can manifest expansions of normal minor subsets and
      also show alterations of antigen expression on certain populations. However, some
      patterns of antigen expression are either never or very rarely encountered in
      reactive T cells. Flow cytometric tools are now available to directly assess
      clonality in specific T-cell populations. Technical and biological pitfalls may
      complicate the interpretation of T-cell flow cytometry. CONCLUSIONS: Flow
      cytometry is a very useful tool in the diagnostic armamentarium for the
      assessment of mature T-cell proliferations, but it must be interpreted based on a
      thorough knowledge of the T-cell immune response, as well as an awareness of
      clinical context.

TI  - Functional characteristics and research trends of PDE11A in human diseases
      (Review).
LID - 10.3892/mmr.2022.12814 [doi]
LID - 298 [pii]
AB  - cAMP and cGMP are important secondary messengers involved in cell regulation and 
      metabolism driven by the G proteincoupled receptor. cAMP is converted via
      adenylyl cyclase (AC) and activates protein kinase A to phosphorylate
      intracellular proteins that mediate specific responses. cAMP signaling serves a
      role at multiple steps in tumorigenesis. The level of cAMP is increased in
      association with cancer cell formation through activation of ACstimulatory G
      protein by mutation. Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP to AMP and
      GMP. PDEs are composed of 11 families, and each can hydrolyze cAMP and cGMP or
      both cAMP and cGMP. PDEs perform various roles depending on their location and
      expression site, and are involved in several diseases, including male erectile
      dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
      PDE11A is the 11th member of the PDE family and is characterized by four splice
      variants with varying tissue expression and Nterminal regulatory regions. Among
      tissues, the expression of PDE11A was highest in the prostate, and it was also
      expressed in hepatic skeletal muscle, pituitary, pancreas and kidney. PDE11A is
      the first PDE associated with an adrenocortical tumor associated genetic
      condition. In several studies, three PDE11A mutations have been reported in
      patients with Cushing syndrome with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical
      disease or isolated micronodular adrenocortical disease without other genetic
      defects. It has been reported that an increase in PDE11A expression affects the
      proliferation of glioblastoma and worsens patient prognosis. The present
      minireview summarizes the location of PDE11A expression, the impact of structural
      differences and disease relevance.

TI  - HXV2O5 Nanocatalysts Combined with Ultrasound for Triple Amplification of
      Oxidative Stress to Enhance Cancer Catalytic Therapy.
LID - 10.1002/anie.202208849 [doi]
AB  - Multiple amplification of tumor oxidative stress has been demonstrated as
      efficient strategy to enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cancer
      therapy. Herein, vanadium-based nanocatalysts, hydrogen vanadium bronzes (HXV2O5 
      , for short HVO), were constructed and employed as novel biocatalysts for
      amplifying tumor oxidative stress and enhancing cancer catalytic therapy. Such
      HVO nanocatalysts harboring multivalent V element possessed multi-functional
      catalytic activity in decomposing H2O2 into *OH and depleting endogenous
      glutathione (GSH) to dually amplify tumor oxidative stress. Meanwhile, HVO
      nanocatalysts could also be activated by ultrasound to further triply amplify
      oxidative stress. The massive intracellular ROS caused mitochondrial dysfunction,
      DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and cell proliferation inhibition, further
      realizing cancer cell death and tumor growth inhibition. Collectively, HVO
      nanocatalysts highlight the remarkable value of ROS-mediated cancer therapies.

TI  - Acute exercise dynamically modulates the hepatic mitochondrial proteome.
LID - 10.1039/d2mo00143h [doi]
AB  - Exercise powerfully increases energy metabolism and substrate flux in tissues, a 
      process reliant on dramatic changes in mitochondrial energetics. Liver
      mitochondria play a multi-factorial role during exercise to fuel hepatic glucose 
      output. We previously showed acute exercise activates hepatic mitophagy, a
      pathway to recycle low-functioning/damaged mitochondria, however little is known 
      how individual bouts of exercise alters the hepatic mitochondrial proteome. Here 
      we leveraged proteomics to examine changes in isolated hepatic mitochondria both 
      immediately after and 2 hours post an acute, 1 hour bout of treadmill exercise in
      female mice. Further, we utilized leupeptin, a lysosomal inhibitor, to capture
      and measure exercise-induced changes in mitochondrial proteins that would have
      been unmeasured due to their targeting for lysosomal degradation. Proteomic
      analysis of enriched hepatic mitochondria identified 3241 total proteins.
      Functional enrichment analysis revealed robust enrichment for proteins critical
      to the mitochondria including metabolic pathways, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and
      electron transport system. Compared to the sedentary condition, exercise elevated
      processes regulating lipid localization, Il-5 signaling, and protein
      phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria. t-SNE analysis identified 4 unique
      expressional clusters driven by time-dependent changes in protein expression.
      Isolation of proteins significantly altered with exercise from each cluster
      revealed influences of leupeptin and exercise both independently and
      cooperatively modulating mitochondrial protein expressional profiles. Overall, we
      provide evidence that acute exercise rapidly modulates changes in the
      proteins/pathways of isolated hepatic mitochondria that include fatty acid
      metabolism/storage, post-translational protein modification, inflammation, and
      oxidative stress. In conclusion, the hepatic mitochondrial proteome undergoes
      extensive remodeling with a bout of exercise.

AB  - Melanoma heterogeneity and plasticity underlie therapy resistance. Some tumour
      cells possess innate resistance, while others reprogramme during drug exposure
      and survive to form persister cells, a source of potential cancer cells for
      recurrent disease. Tracing individual melanoma cell populations through tumour
      regression and into recurrent disease remains largely unexplored, in part,
      because complex animal models are required for live imaging of cell populations
      over time. Here, we apply tamoxifen-inducible creERt2/loxP lineage tracing to a
      zebrafish model of MITF-dependent melanoma regression and recurrence to image and
      trace cell populations in vivo through disease stages. Using this strategy, we
      show that melanoma persister cells at the minimal residual disease site originate
      from the primary tumour. Next, we fate mapped rare MITF-independent persister
      cells and demonstrate that these cells directly contribute to progressive
      disease. Multiplex immunohistochemistry confirmed MITF-independent persister
      cells give rise to Mitfa+ cells in recurrent disease. Taken together, our work
      reveals a direct contribution of persister cell populations to recurrent disease,
      and provides a resource for lineage tracing methodology in adult zebrafish cancer
      models.

      chromosomal instability.

LID - 10.1242/jcs.260031 [doi]
AB  - Chromosomal instability (CIN), the process of increased chromosomal alterations, 
      compromises genomic integrity and has profound consequences on human health. Yet,
      our understanding of the molecular and mechanistic basis of CIN initiation
      remains limited. We developed a high-throughput, single-cell image-based pipeline
      employing deep learning and spot counting models to detect CIN by automatically
      counting chromosomes and micronuclei. To identify CIN-initiating conditions, we
      used CRISPR activation in human diploid cells to upregulate, at
      physiologically-relevant levels, 14 genes that are functionally important in
      cancer. We found that upregulation of CCND1, FOXA1, and NEK2 resulted in
      pronounced changes in chromosome counts and KIF11 upregulation resulted in
      micronuclei formation. We identified KIF11-dependent fragilities within the
      mitotic spindle; increased KIF11 causes centrosome fragmentation, higher
      microtubule stability, lagging chromosomes or mitotic catastrophe. Our findings
      demonstrate that even modest average single gene expression changes in a
      karyotypically stable background are sufficient for initiating CIN by exposing
      fragilities of the mitotic spindle which can lead to a genomically-diverse cell
      population.

TI  - European Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Gynecologic Oncology Survey:
      Status of ERAS protocol implementation across Europe.
LID - 10.1002/ijgo.14386 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: ERAS protocols have been shown to improve surgical and clinical
      outcomes. The aim of this survey was to acquire a comprehensive assessment of the
      current status of implementation of ERAS protocols across Europe. METHODS: The
      survey was launched by The European Network of Young gynecologic oncologists
      (ENYGO). A 45 item survey was disseminated online through the European Society of
      Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) Network database. RESULTS: A total of 116 ESGO
      centers participated in the survey between December 2020 and June 2021. Overall, 
      80 (70%) centers reported that ERAS was implemented at their institution. 63%
      reported a length of stay (LOS) for advanced ovarian cancer surgery between 5-7
      days; 57 (81%) centers reported a LOS between 2-4 days in patients who underwent 
      an early-stage gynecological cancer surgery. The ERAS items with high reported
      compliance (>75% 'normally-always') included deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis
      (89%), antibiotic prophylaxis (79%), prevention of hypothermia (55%) and early
      mobilization (55%). The ERAS items that were poorly adhered to (less than 50%)
      included early removal of urinary catheter (33%), and avoidance of drains (25%). 
      CONCLUSION: This survey shows broad implementation of ERAS protocols across
      Europe, however, a wide variation in adherence to the various ERAS protocol items
      were reported.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Symptom Cluster is Associated With Epigenetic Regulation of
      Lymphotoxin Beta in Oncology Patients Receiving Chemotherapy.
PG  - 10998004221115863
LID - 10.1177/10998004221115863 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: While the gastrointestinal symptom cluster (GISC) is common in
      patients receiving chemotherapy, limited information is available on its
      underlying mechanism(s). Emerging evidence suggests a role for inflammatory
      processes through the actions of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling
      pathway. This study evaluated for associations between a GISC and levels of DNA
      methylation for genes within this pathway. METHODS: Prior to their second or
      third cycle of chemotherapy, 1071 outpatients reported symptom occurrence using
      the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. A GISC was identified using exploratory
      factor analysis. Differential methylation analyses were performed in two
      independent samples using EPIC (n = 925) and 450K (n = 146) microarrays. Trans
      expression-associated CpG (eCpG) loci for 56 NF-kappaB signaling pathway genes
      were evaluated. Loci significance were assessed using an exploratory false
      discovery rate (FDR) of 25% for the EPIC sample. For the validation assessment
      using the 450K sample, significance was assessed at an unadjusted p-value of
      0.05. RESULTS: For the EPIC sample, the GISC was associated with increased
      expression of lymphotoxin beta (LTB) at one differentially methylated trans eCpG 
      locus (cg03171795; FDR = 0.168). This association was not validated in the 450K
      sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify an association between a
      GISC and epigenetic regulation of a gene that is involved in the initiation of
      gastrointestinal immune responses. Findings suggest that increased LTB expression
      by hypermethylation of a trans eCpG locus is involved in the occurrence of this
      cluster in patients receiving chemotherapy. LTB may be a potential therapeutic
      target for this common cluster.

TI  - Is extremely low frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields applicable to gliomas? A
      literature review of the underlying mechanisms and application of extremely low
      frequency pulsed electromagnetic fields.
LID - 10.1002/cam4.5112 [doi]
AB  - Gliomas refer to a group of complicated human brain tumors with a low 5-year
      survival rate and limited therapeutic options. Extremely low-frequency pulsed
      electromagnetic field (ELF-PEMF) is a specific magnetic field featuring almost no
      side effects. However, the application of ELF-PEMF in the treatment of gliomas is
      rare. This review summarizes five significant underlying mechanisms including
      calcium ions, autophagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and reactive oxygen species,
      and applications of ELF-PEMF in glioma treatment from a clinical practice
      perspective. In addition, the prospects of ELF-PEMF in combination with
      conventional therapy for the treatment of gliomas are reviewed. This review
      benefits any specialists, especially oncologists, interested in this new therapy 
      because it can help treat patients with gliomas properly.

TI  - Real-world management patterns in EGFR-mutant advanced non-small-cell lung cancer
      before first-line adoption of osimertinib: the REFLECT study in Greece.
LID - 10.2217/fon-2022-0386 [doi]
AB  - Aim: To retrospectively characterize real-world therapeutic strategies, clinical 
      outcomes and attrition rates with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), before 
      first-line osimertinib approval, in EGFR-mutated advanced/metastatic
      non-small-cell lung cancer patients in Greece. Results: Among 160 patients, the
      discontinuation rate for first-line first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs was
      85%; among these patients, 43% did not receive any second-line therapy and 9.4%
      died during an 18.7-month follow-up period. Median progression-free and overall
      survival were 12.1 and 20.9 months, respectively. Osimertinib was offered as
      second- and third-line treatment in 69.6 and 21.7% of patients with the T790M
      mutation, respectively. Brain metastases were recorded in 10.6% of patients
      during treatment, with median overall survival of 4.9 months. Conclusion: Given
      the high attrition rates and the impact of CNS progression, offering the most
      appropriate first-line EGFR-TKI treatment with CNS penetration is key to maximize
      outcomes.

OAB - Based on the results of clinical and real-world studies, EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are considered the first-line standard of care for people 
      with a type of cancer, know as EGFR-mutant advanced/metastatic non-small-cell
      lung cancer. However, treatment patterns and outcomes after progression are less 
      well reported and could impact the first-line EGFR-TKI therapeutic approach. This
      study is part of a large European analysis of real-world evidence, known as the
      REFLECT study, the objective of which is to learn more about the characterization
      of testing and treatment patterns, as well as attrition rates, in people
      receiving first-line treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs. Trial

TI  - Use of single-energy proton pencil beam scanning Bragg peak for
      intensity-modulated proton therapy FLASH treatment planning in liver
      hypofractionated radiation therapy.
LID - 10.1002/mp.15894 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The transmission proton FLASH technique delivers high doses to the
      normal tissue distal to the target, which is less conformal compared to the Bragg
      peak technique. To investigate FLASH RT planning using single-energy Bragg peak
      beams with a similar beam arrangement as clinical intensity-modulated proton
      therapy (IMPT) in liver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and to
      characterize the plan quality, dose sparing of organs-at-risk (OARs), and FLASH
      dose rate percentage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An in-house platform was developed
      to enable inverse IMPT-FLASH planning using single-energy Bragg peaks. A
      universal range shifter and range compensators were utilized to effectively align
      the Bragg peak to the distal edge of the target. Two different minimum MU
      settings of 400 and 800 MU/spot (Bragg-400MU and Bragg-800MU) plans were
      investigated on 10 consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously
      treated by IMPT-SBRT to evaluate the FLASH dose and dose rate coverage for OARs. 
      The IMPT-FLASH using single-energy Bragg peaks delivered 50 Gy in 5 fractions
      with similar or identical beam arrangement to the clinical IMPT-SBRT plans. NRG
      GI003 dose constraint metrics were used. Three dose rate calculation methods,
      including average dose rate (ADR), dose threshold dose rate (DTDR), and
      dose-averaged dose rate (DADR), were all studied. RESULTS: The novel spot map
      optimization can fulfill the inverse planning using single-energy Bragg peaks.
      All the Bragg peak FLASH plans achieved similar results for the liver-GTV Dmean
      and heart D0.5cc , compared to SBRT-IMPT. The Bragg-800MU plans resulted in 18.3%
      higher CTV D2cc compared with SBRT (p < 0.05), and no significant difference was 
      found between Bragg-400MU and SBRT plans. For the CTV Dmax , SBRT plans resulted 
      in 10.3% (p<0.01) less than Bragg-400MU plans and 16.6% (p<0.01) less than
      Bragg-800MU plans. The Bragg-800MU plans generally achieved higher ADR, DADR, and
      DTDR dose rates than Bragg-400MU plans, and DADR mostly led to the highest
      V40Gy/s compared to other dose rate calculation methods, whereas ADR led to the
      lowest. The lower dose rate portions in certain OARs are related to the lower
      dose deposited due to the farther distances from targets, especially in the
      penumbra of the beams. CONCLUSION: Single-energy Bragg peak IMPT-FLASH plans
      eliminate the exit dose in normal tissues, maintaining comparable dose metrics to
      the conventional IMPT-SBRT plans while achieving a sufficient FLASH dose rate for
      liver cancers. This study demonstrates the feasibility of and sufficiently high
      dose rate when applying Bragg peak FLASH treatment for liver cancer
      hypofractionated FLASH therapy. The advancement of this novel method has the
      potential to optimize treatment for liver cancer patients. This article is

TI  - Interest of individual breast cancer screening by mammography in women aged over 
      75 years
PG  - 182-189
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1035 [doi]
AB  - Organized breast cancer screening in France is recommended for women up to 74
      years of age, while the frequency and severity of this cancer increases after 75 
      years. The aim of this work is to assess the potential benefits of extending
      organized screening. Methodology: Retrospective study of a continuous monocentric
      series of women over 75 having undergone surgery for breast cancer. The following
      variables were studied: addressing after screening or not, age at diagnosis, UICC
      stage and therapeutic measures (surgery by lumpectomy or mastectomy, lymph node
      dissection, adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or hormone
      therapy). Results: 185 women aged 82.8 +/- 5.2 years [extreme ages 75 to 95] were
      included in the study. 136 (73.5%) breast cancers were discovered after palpation
      and 49 (26.5%) after screening mammography. The distribution by stage was: I -
      38.8%, II - 39.5%, III - 15.1% and stage IV - 7%. 164 (87.7%), patients received 
      surgical treatment: 115 lumpectomies (61.2%) and 49 mastectomies (26.5%). 51
      (27.6%) patients underwent lymph node dissection. The distribution of adjuvant
      treatments was: chemotherapy 21.1%, radiotherapy 68.6%, or hormone therapy
      (79.5%), sometimes combined. Women not screened are older than women screened (84
      +/- 5.3 versus 79.5 +/- 3.6 years; p < 0.0001). Cancers are diagnosed at a more
      advanced stage in non-screened patients compared to screened patients (p <
      0.0001). While there is a higher proportion of stage I among screened patients
      (75.5%), stage II is the most frequent in women not screened (47%). Stage I and
      II are the majority in the latter (72%). In multivariate analysis with adjustment
      for age, screening made it possible to make a diagnosis at a less advanced stage 
      (stage I-II vs II-IV: OR = 5.593; 95% CI [1.575-19.866]; p = 0.0078) and to have 
      conservative surgery more often (lumpectomy vs mastectomy: OR = 2.645; 95% CI
      [1.079-6.493]; p = 0.0333) without more recourse to surgery (OR = 1.856 95% CI
      [0.207-16.612]; p = 0.58). After adjusting for age and stage, screening was no
      longer a determining factor in the choice of type of surgery (OR = 1.934; 95% CI 
      [0.753-4.975]; p = 0.170). Conclusion: At the age when organized breast cancer
      screening in France stopped, there was a decrease in survival, a diagnosis at a
      higher stage and an increase in co-morbidities. Our study shows a change in
      management with heavier treatment, more complications and a greater loss of
      autonomy without screening. This pleads for a continuation beyond 75 years of the
      practice of mammography screening for breast cancer in elderly women.

TI  - Glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 and its DNA methylation can be
      biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer.
PG  - e24628
LID - 10.1002/jcla.24628 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer ranking high in the cancer-related list has long perplexed
      patients, in which glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1) is found
      to be highly expressed. Besides, DNA methylation is perceived as a biomarker to
      assess the prognosis of patients with various cancers. However, the correlation
      between GNPNAT1 and DNA methylation and the role of GNPNAT1 in lung cancer remain
      vague. METHODS: Principal component analysis (PCA), heatmap, volcano map, Venn
      diagram, gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
      analysis were used to screen out the candidate genes. The viability, migration,
      and invasion of lung cancer cells were detected by CCK-8 and Transwell assays. An
      xenograft tumor mouse model was established. The relative expressions of GNPNAT1,
      E-cadherin, vimentin, Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of
      metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), E2F1, and cyclin D1 in cells or xenograft tumor
      tissues were quantified by Western blot, RT-qPCR, or immunohistochemistry assay. 
      RESULTS: GNPNAT1 was screened as the research object. GNPNAT1 methylation was
      downregulated, while GNPNAT1 expression was upregulated in lung cancer tissues.
      The methylation and mRNA levels of GNPNAT1 were correlated with the patient
      prognosis. GNPNAT1 increased cell viability, migration and invasion, and promoted
      the xenograft tumor volume and weight, whereas shGNPNAT1 acted oppositely.
      Moreover, expressions of Vimentin, MMP-2, E2F1, and cyclin D1 were increased, but
      E-cadherin and TIMP-2 expressions were decreased by overexpressed GNPNAT1, whilst
      GNPNAT1 knockdown ran conversely. CONCLUSION: GNPNAT1 and methylated GNPNAT1
      coverage are biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer.

AB  - Malignant tumors, particularly those located in deep tissues, have always been a 
      grievous threat to human health. Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has recently attracted
      great attention due to deep tissue penetration. However, the lack of effective
      sonosensitizers and the poor therapeutic efficacy severely limit their wider use.
      Herein, dual-functionalized black phosphorus nanosheets (BP@PEI-PEG, i.e., PPBP) 
      integrating black oxygen-deficient titanium dioxide particles (B-TiO2) were
      successfully constructed (PPBP-B-TiO2) for synergistic photothermal
      (PTT)/sonodynamic therapy. In these nanocomposites, black titanium dioxide can
      enhance the separation of electrons (e(-)) and holes (h(+)) due to the
      oxygen-deficient structure and significantly improves the production of reactive 
      oxygen species (ROS) for SDT, while the BP nanosheets endow the nanocomposites
      with a higher photothermal conversion capability for photothermal therapy (eta = 
      44.1%) which can prolong the blood circulation and improve the O2 supply. In vivo
      experiments prove that PPBP-B-TiO2 nanocomposites exhibited outstanding tumor
      inhibition efficacy and excellent biocompatibility. This work provides a
      prospective platform for combined photothermal/sonodynamic cancer therapy.

AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) is an essential component of the tumor
      microenvironment. It plays a critical role in regulating cell-cell and
      cell-matrix interactions. However, there is lack of systematic and comparative
      studies on different widely-used ECM mimicking hydrogels and their properties,
      making the selection of suitable hydrogels for mimicking different in vivo
      conditions quite random. This study systematically evaluates the biophysical
      attributes of three widely used natural hydrogels (Matrigel, collagen gel and
      agarose gel) including complex modulus, loss tangent, diffusive permeability and 
      pore size. A new and facile method was developed combining Critical Point Drying,
      Scanning Electron Microscopy imaging and a MATLAB image processing program (CSM
      method) for the characterization of hydrogel microstructures. This CSM method
      allows accurate measurement of the hydrogel pore size down to nanometer
      resolution. Furthermore, a microfluidic device was implemented to measure the
      hydrogel permeability (Pd) as a function of particle size and gel concentration. 
      Among the three gels, collagen gel has the lowest complex modulus, medium pore
      size, and the highest loss tangent. Agarose gel exhibits the highest complex
      modulus, the lowest loss tangent and the smallest pore size. Collagen gel and
      Matrigel produced complex moduli close to that estimated for cancer ECM. The Pd
      of these hydrogels decreases significantly with the increase of particle size. By
      assessing different hydrogels' biophysical characteristics, this study provides
      valuable insights for tailoring their properties for various three-dimensional
      cancer models.

AB  - Hydrogels are functional materials that are similar to human skin and have
      received much attention in recent years for biomedical applications. However, the
      preparation of nontoxic, highly adhesive, and antimicrobial hydrogels in an
      efficient way remains a great challenge. Inspired by adhesive mussel foot
      proteins (mfps) which consist of abundant catecholic amino acids and lysine (Lys)
      residues, gallic acid-modified epsilon-poly-L-lysine (EPL/GA) was synthesized,
      and an active functional monomer (AA-EPL/GA) was then created through a reaction 
      with acrylic acid (AA). The polymerization of AA-EPL/GA occurred rapidly (30-160 
      s) under blue light (lambda = 405 nm) irradiation to produce a biomimetic
      PAA-EPL/GA hydrogel under mild conditions. The biomimetic pyrogallol-Lys
      distribution endowed the PAA-EPL/GA hydrogels with superior adhesion in humid
      environments (with an adhesive strength of 50.02 kPa toward wet porcine skin) and
      tunable mechanical and self-healing properties. Additionally, the PAA-EPL/GA
      hydrogels exhibited outstanding antibacterial ability due to the inherent
      characteristics of GA and EPL. In a mouse model, PAA-EPL/GA adhered firmly around
      the wound tissues. Photographs of the wound and the histological results
      demonstrated the ability of the hydrogel to promote wound healing, control wound 
      infection, and suppress scar formation. Moreover, the hydrogel had a good
      hemostatic effect on liver bleeding. Our results highlighted the promising
      application potential of GA-based hydrogels, which were easily, harmlessly, and
      efficiently fabricated by blue light irradiation.

AB  - The blocking of gastric mucosal intestinal metaplasia (IM) has been considered to
      be the pivotal method to control the occurrence of gastric cancer. However, there
      is still a lack of effective therapeutic agent. Here, we developed
      mucus-penetrating liposome system by covering surface with polyethylene glycol
      (PEG) chains (hydrophilic and electroneutral mucus-inert material) to co-delivery
      candidate drugs combination. Then studied the impact on the transmucus
      performance of different conformations, which were constructed by controlling the
      density of PEG chains on the surface. The results showed that the particle size
      of 5%PEG-Lip was less than 120 nm, the polydispersity index was less than 0.3,
      and the surface potential tended to be neutral. The D value (long chain spacing) 
      of 5% PEG-Lip was 3.25 nm, which was close to the RF value (diameter of spherical
      PEG long chain group without external force interference) of 3.44 nm, and the L
      value (extended length) was slightly larger than 3.44 nm. In this case, PEG
      showed mushroom-brush transitional conformation on the surface of liposomes. This
      conformation was not only promoted stable delivery, but also shielded the capture
      of mucus more favorably, leading to a more unrestricted transportation in mucus. 
      The further in vivo experimental results demonstrated the rapid distribution of
      liposomes, which gradually appeared both in the superficial and deep glandular of
      mucosa and gland cells at 1 h and absorbed into the cell cytoplasm at 6 h. The 5%
      PEG-Lip with the mushroom-brush transitional configuration recalled abnormal
      organ index and improved inflammation and intestinal metaplasia. The modified PEG
      conformation assay presented here was more suitable for liposomes. This
      PEG-modified liposome system has potential of mucus-penetrating and provides a
      strategy for local treatment of gastric mucosal intestinal metaplasia.

AB  - Chronic nonhealing wounds are one of the most common and serious complications of
      diabetes, which can lead to disability of patients. Adipose-derived stem cells
      (ADSCs) have emerged as a promising tool for skin wound healing, but the
      therapeutic potential depends considerably on the cell delivery system. Small
      intestinal submucosa (SIS) is an extracellular matrix-based membranous scaffold
      with outstanding repair potential for skin wounds. In this study, we first
      fabricated a bioactive wound dressing, termed the SIS+ADSCs composite, by using
      human ADSCs as the seed cell and porcine SIS as the cell delivery vehicle. Then, 
      we systematically investigated, for the first time, the healing potential of this
      wound dressing in a rat model of type 2 diabetes. In vitro studies revealed that 
      SIS provided a favorable microenvironment for ADSCs and significantly promoted
      the expression of growth factors critical for chronic wound healing. After
      implantation in the full-thickness skin wounds of diabetic rats, the SIS+ADSCs
      composite showed a higher wound healing rate and wound healing quality than those
      in the PBS, ADSCs, and SIS groups. Along with the ability to modulate the
      polarization of macrophages in vivo, the SIS+ADSCs composite was potent at
      promoting wound angiogenesis, reepithelialization, and skin appendage
      regeneration. Taken together, these results indicate that the SIS+ADSCs composite
      has good therapeutic potential and high translational value for diabetic wound
      treatment.

AB  - In this work, the magnetic alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterogeneous nanotubes were
      successfully prepared by solvent hydrothermal-controlled calcination method. The 
      effects of additive concentration, hydrothermal temperature and time on
      morphology of products were investigated. The alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 nanotubes with a 
      saturation magnetization of 50 emu/g were prepared calcinated at 600 degrees C
      for 4 h using 0.8 g of glucose. Their average length, the outer and inner
      diameters were around 240 nm, 178 nm and 145 nm, respectively. The
      alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4 heterogeneous nanotubes coated with water-soluble liposome were
      applied for targeted delivery of curcumin. The release of curcumin inside the
      hollow structure of the nanocomposites could be triggered and effectively
      sustained represented a process of slow release. The encapsulation efficiency of 
      curcumin in the alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4-CUR@LIP nanocomposites reached 82.1 +/- 0.9%.
      MTT assays demonstrated that blank carriers had excellent biocompatibility and
      application of magnetic field significantly elevated the cytotoxicity of
      alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4-CUR@LIP nanocomposites on MCF-7 cell. Electrochemical
      experiment and Prussian blue staining indicated that the alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4@LIP
      nanocomposites could aggregate in cells to promote the internalization of
      curcumin. Magnetic alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4-CUR@LIP nanocomposites and curcumin enhanced
      the expression of reactive oxygen species in MCF-7 cells and induced apoptosis by
      fluorescence detection. Flow cytometry and western blot verified that the
      alpha-Fe2O3/Fe3O4@LIP nanocomposites under magnetic field enhanced cells
      late-apoptosis by adjusting the expression of apoptosis-related proteins.

AB  - In this work, redox-sensitive polyurethane urea (PUU) based electrospun membranes
      have been exploited to chemically tether a pH-sensitive doxorubicin derivative
      achieved by linking a lipoyl hydrazide to the drug via a hydrazone linkage.
      First, the lipoyl-hydrazone-doxorubicin derivative labelled as LA-Hy-Doxo has
      been synthesized and characterized. Then, the molecule has been tethered, via a
      thiol-disulfide exchange reaction, to the redox-sensitive PUU (PolyCEGS)
      electrospun membrane. The redox-sensitive PolyCEGS PUU has been produced by using
      PCL-PEG-PCL polyol and glutathione-tetramethyl ester (GSSG-OMe)4 as a chain
      extender. The LA-Hy-Doxo tethered electrospun membrane has showed a dually
      controlled release triggered by acidic and reducing conditions, producing a
      significant cytotoxic effect in human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) which has 
      validated the system for the post-surgical treatment of solid tumors to contrast 
      recurrence.

AB  - Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have gained significant growing attention in the
      recent past due to their peculiar characteristics including smaller size, high
      surface area, photoluminescence, chemical stability, facile synthesis and
      functionalization possibilities. They are carbon nanostructures having less than 
      10 nm size with fluorescent properties. In recent years, the scientific community
      is curiously adopting biomass precursors for the preparation of CQDs over the
      chemical compounds. These biomass sources are sustainable, eco-friendly,
      inexpensive, widely available and convert waste into valuable materials. Hence in
      our work the fundamental understating of diverse fabrication methodologies of
      CQDs, and the types of raw materials employed in recent times, are all examined
      and correlated comprehensively. Their unique combination of remarkable
      properties, together with the ease with which they can be fabricated, makes CQDs 
      as promising materials for applications in diverse biomedical fields, in
      particular for bio-imaging, targeted drug delivery and phototherapy for cancer
      treatment. The mechanism for luminescence is of considerable significance for
      leading the synthesis of CQDs with tunable fluorescence emission. Therefore, it
      is aimed to explore and provide an updated review on (i) the recent progress on
      the different synthesis methods of biomass-derived CQDs, (ii) the contribution of
      surface states or functional groups on the luminescence origin and (iii) its
      potential application for cancer theranostics, concentrating on their
      fluorescence properties. Finally, we explored the challenges in modification for 
      the synthesis of CQDs from biomass derivatives and the future scope of CQDs in
      phototherapy for cancer theranostics.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an experimental and computational study of the
      adhesion of triptorelin-conjugated PEG-coated biosynthesized gold nanoparticles
      (GNP-PEG-TRP) to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The adhesion is
      studied at the nanoscale using a combination of atomic force microscopy (AFM)
      experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The AFM measurements showed 
      that the triptorelin-functionalized gold nanoparticles (GNP-TRP and GNP-PEG-TRP) 
      have higher adhesion to triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) than
      non-tumorigenic breast cells. The increased adhesion of GNP-TRP and GNP-PEG-TRP
      to TNBC is also attributed to the overexpression of LHRH receptors on the
      surfaces of both TNBC. Finally, the molecular dynamics model reveals insights
      into the effects of receptor density, molecular configuration, and
      receptor-ligand docking characteristics on the interactions of
      triptorelin-functionalized PEG-coated gold nanoparticles with TNBC. A three to
      nine-fold increase in the adhesion is predicted between
      triptorelin-functionalized PEG-coated gold nanoparticles and TNBC cells. The
      implications of the results are then discussed for the specific targeting of
      TNBC.

AB  - We used reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which has two times higher photothermal
      conversion efficiency than graphene oxide (GO), as a photothermal agent for
      cancer photothermal therapy (PTT). By conjugating a photosensitizer IR780 to rGO,
      the IR780-rGO could be endowed with reactive oxygen species (ROSs) generation
      ability for concurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT). The IR780-rGO was coated with 
      hyaluronic acid (HA) by electrostatic interaction to facilitate its intracellular
      uptake by U87 glioblastoma cells. The IR780-rGO/HA was loaded with doxorubicin
      (DOX) for chemotherapy (CT), to develop a pH-responsive drug delivery
      nano-platform for targeted multimodal cancer CT/PTT/PDT. We fully characterized
      the properties of all nanocomposites during the synthesis steps. The high loading
      efficiency of DOX on IR780-rGO-HA provides 3 mg/mg drug loading, while
      IR780-rGO-HA/DOX shows 3 times higher drug release at endosomal pH value (pH 5)
      than at pH 7.4. The mechanism for PTT/PDT was confirmed from the ability of
      IR780-rGO-HA to induce time-dependent temperature rise, synthesis of heat shock
      protein 70 (HSP70) and generation of intracellular ROSs, after exposure to 808 nm
      near infrared (NIR) laser light. The nano-vehicle IR780-rGO-HA shows high
      biocompatibility toward 3T3 fibroblast and U87 cancer cell lines, as well as
      enhanced intracellular uptake by U87 through active targeting. This translates
      into increased cytotoxicity of IR780-rGO-HA/DOX, by lowering the drug
      half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) from 0.7 to 0.46 mug/mL. This IC50
      is further decreased to 0.1 mug/mL by irradiation with NIR laser for 3 min at 1.5
      W/cm(2). The elevated cancer cell killing mechanism was supported from flow
      cytometry analysis, where the highest cell apoptosis/necrosis rate was observed
      in combination CT/PTT/PDT. Using xenograft tumor model created by subcutaneous
      implantation of U87 cells in nude mice, IR780-rGO-HA/DOX delivered through
      intravenous (IV) injection and followed with 808 nm laser treatment for 5 min at 
      1.5 W/cm(2) results in the lowest tumor growth rate, with negligible change of
      tumor volume from its original value at the end 20-day observation period. The
      therapeutic efficacy was supported from inhibited cell proliferation rate,
      increased cell apoptosis rate, and increased production of HSP70 from
      immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue slices. The safety of the
      NIR-assisted multimodal cancer treatment could be confirmed from non-significant 
      change of body weight and hematological parameters of blood sample. Taken
      together, we conclude that IV delivery of IR780-rGO-HA/DOX plus NIR laser
      treatment is an effective nanomedicine approach for combination cancer therapy.

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging therapeutic modality for cancer, which
      remains in critical need of effective delivery vectors due to the unfavorable
      biopharmaceutical properties of small RNAs. Polyamines are essential for
      functioning of mammalian cells. Dysregulated polyamine metabolism is found in
      many cancers and has been an attractive therapeutic target in combination
      therapies. Combination therapies based on drugs that affect polyamine metabolism 
      and nucleic acids promise to enhance anticancer activity due to a cooperative
      effect on multiple oncogenic pathways. Here, we report bioactive polycationic
      prodrug (F-PaP) based on an anticancer polyamine analogue bisethylnorspermine
      (BENSpm) modified with perfluoroalkyl moieties. Following encapsulation of siRNA,
      F-PaP/siRNA nanoparticles were coated with hyaluronic acid (HA) to form ternary
      nanoparticles HA@F-PaP/siRNA. The presence of perfluoroalkyl moieties and HA
      reduced cell membrane toxicity and improved stability of the particles with
      cooperatively enhanced siRNA delivery in pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines. 
      We then tested a therapeutic hypothesis that combining BENSpm with siRNA
      silencing of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) would result in cooperative cancer cell
      killing. HA@F-PaP/siPLK1 induced polyamine catabolism and cell cycle arrest,
      leading to enhanced apoptosis in the tested cell lines. The HA-coated
      nanoparticles facilitated tumor accumulation and contributed to strong tumor
      inhibition and favorable modulation of the immune tumor microenvironment in
      orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.

AB  - Angiogenesis is a vital step in many severe diseases such as cancer, diabetic
      retinopathy, and rheumatoid arthritis. Sorafenib (SFB), a multi-tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, has recently been shown to inhibit tumor progression and suppress
      angiogenesis. Its narrow therapeutic window, however, has limited its clinical
      application and therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, in this study, a nanocomposite
      formulation comprising of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and poly (D,
      l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles was functionalized with an
      integrin-targeting ligand (RGD peptide) to improve SFB delivery for the treatment
      of angiogenesis. Physicochemical and biological properties of the targeted
      nanocomposite were evaluated in terms of chemical structure, morphology, particle
      size, zeta potential, photoluminescence, and cell toxicity. The loading capacity 
      of the nanocomposite was optimized at different drug-to-PLGA ratios. Drug release
      behavior was also investigated at 37 degrees C in pH = 7.4. The SFB-to-PLGA ratio
      of 1:3 was selected as the optimum condition which resulted in the encapsulation 
      efficiency and encapsulation capacity of 68.93 +/- 1.39 and 18.77 +/- 0.46,
      respectively. Photoluminescence properties of GQD in nanocomposite were used to
      track the delivery system. The results indicated that conjugating targeting
      ligand could enhance cellular uptake of nanocomposite in cells overexpressing
      integrin receptors. In vivo anti-angiogenesis activity of targeted nanocomposite 
      was investigated in chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). The findings showed
      that SFB loaded in the targeted nanocomposite reduced VEGF secretion in vitro and
      its anti-angiogenic effect surpass free SFB. Thanks to its unique therapeutic and
      bioimaging properties, the developed nanocomposite could be an effective drug
      delivery system for poorly water-soluble therapeutic agents.

AB  - Therapeutic drug delivery is known to be influenced by interplay between various 
      design parameters of delivery carriers which influence the drug uptake efficiency
      and subsequently the effectiveness of treatment. Amongst, the several design
      parameters such as size, shape and surface charge, particle shape is gaining
      attention as a crucial design parameter for development of robust and efficient
      delivery carriers. In this exploration, we investigated the influence of particle
      shape on injectability and therapeutic effectiveness of the delivery carriers
      using doxorubicin (DOX) conjugated polymeric microparticles. Results of
      injectability experiments demonstrated the influence of particle shape with
      anisotropic rod-shaped particles displaying increased injectability as against
      spherical particles. Impact of particle shape on therapeutic effectiveness was
      assessed against small cell lung cancer (SCLC) which was selected as a model
      disease. Results of cellular uptake studies revealed preferential uptake of
      rod-shaped particles than spherical particles in cancer cells. These results were
      further validated by in-vitro tumor simulation studies wherein rod-shaped
      particles displayed enhanced anti-tumorigenic activity along with distortion of
      tumor integrity against spheres. Furthermore, the impact of particle size was
      also assessed on cardiotoxicity, an adverse effect of DOX which limits its
      therapeutic use. Results illustrated that the high aspect ratio particles
      displayed diminished cardiotoxicity activity. These results provide valuable
      insights about influence of particle shape for designing efficient therapeutics.

AB  - The present work reports on a new approach based on electroactive
      microenvironments to mitigate skeletal muscle cancer. For that, piezoelectric
      films based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) have been applied to evaluate the
      influence of mechano- and/or electrical stimuli on rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
      proliferation. Human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells were cultured on PVDF 
      pristine films with different surface charge (non-poled, poled+ and poled-) and
      magnetic composites (10% and 20% Fe3O4, and 20% CFO filler content) to allow
      magneto-mechanical and magnetoelectrical stimulation films. Electrospun PVDF
      pristine (oriented and randomly) and magnetic (10% Fe3O4) fiber mats were also
      evaluated to take into consideration the morphology effect on cell response. It
      was found that the mechanical stimuli enhance RMS proliferation whereas the
      mechano-electrical decreases it. It was also verified that the RD cells
      proliferate better on randomly oriented fibers, whereas myoblast cells do it
      better in oriented ones. The obtained results confirm that electroactive
      microenvironments can be used to develop novel and effective approaches to deal
      with RMS cancer, that can be extrapolated to others cancer types.

AB  - Temperature-trigger chemotherapy is one of the state-of-the-art anti-tumoral
      strategies in nanomedicine. However, this strategy is in close relationship with 
      the effect of the temperature in the tumor tissue. With high temperatures, the
      ablation of the tumor tissue can hinder a correct chemotherapy approximation. On 
      the other hand, with moderate temperatures a negative vascularization that
      promotes the tumor growing is produced and competes with the chemotherapeutic
      effects. We have constructed one nanogel system composed of a thermoresponsive
      polymer cross-linked by plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for
      temperature-trigger chemotherapy. Doxorubicin loaded in the porous interior of
      the nanogel is released when the thermoresponsive network of the nanogel
      collapses due to the heat generated by the AuNPs upon near infra-red light
      irradiation. The hybrid nanogel system has been tested in vitro and in vivo,
      where it was observed that the temperatures reached in the in vivo NIR
      irradiation have an undesired effect on the inhibition of the tumor growth while 
      the drug loaded systems considerably reduced the tumor sizes. This study shows
      the importance of design in temperature triggered antitumoral systems, where
      lower temperatures usually reached in practical situations due to light
      attenuation produced by the tissue can be positively utilized for enhancing the
      antitumoral effect of loaded drugs in the system.

AB  - Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine (GEM) is recognized as the
      standard of care to improve the prognosis of patients with resected pancreatic
      cancer (PC); however, it is greatly limited by poor absorption of chemotherapy
      agents. Moreover, surgical site infection and Gammaproteobacteria-induced GEM
      resistance further decrease the chemotherapy efficacy and increase the risk of
      recurrence and even mortality. Here, we develop an implantable anti-bacterial and
      anti-cancer fibrous membrane (AAFM) to inhibit PC recurrence in a
      well-coordinated manner. Our AAFM can be readily prepared via simple
      co-electrospinning of GEM and poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) and subsequent tannic
      acid (TA)-mediated in-situ generation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The
      resultant membrane presents highly porous fibrous morphology and appropriate
      mechanical performance. Most importantly, we find the surface-deposited TA/AgNP
      complexes can exert multiple therapeutic effects: (1) they can act as a fence to 
      extend GEM diffusion route, achieving a sustained drug release; (2) they can
      fight the pathogenic microorganisms in the local microenvironment and prevent
      infectious complications and alleviate Gammaproteobacteria-induced chemotherapy
      resistance; (3) they can combat residual cancer cells to synchronously strengthen
      the effectiveness of GEM-based chemotherapy. Altogether, our AAFM provides a
      proof-of-concept demonstration of the integrated anti-cancer and anti-bacterial
      strategy for enhanced therapeutic efficacy and will inspire the design of other
      high-performance implants for prevention of tumor relapse.

AB  - Inspired by the critical role of nanocarrier in biomaterials modification, we
      synthesized a mesoporous rod-structure hydroxyapatite (MR-HAp) nanoparticles for 
      boosting gambogic acid (GA) bioavailability in cells and improving the tumor
      therapy. As expected, the GA loading ratio of MR-HAp was up to about 96.97% and
      GA-loaded MR-HAp (MR-HAp/GA) demonstrates a sustained release performance.
      Furthermore, a substantial improvement was observed in inhibiting the cell
      proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of HeLa cells, as the cell viability was
      decreased to 89.6% and the apoptosis was increased to 49.2% when the cells
      treated with MR-HAp/GA at a GA concentration of 1 mug/mL for 72 h. The remarkable
      inhibition effect of cell proliferation and the enhanced inducing apoptosis are
      attributed to the increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species level and
      reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. This result provides a promising and
      facile approach for highly efficient tumor treatment.

AB  - Nanotechnology has immensely advanced the field of cancer diagnostics and
      treatment by introducing potential delivery vehicles as carriers for drugs or
      therapeutic agents. In due course, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have
      emerged as excellent vehicles for delivering drugs, biomolecules, and
      biomaterials, attributed to their solid framework and porosity providing a higher
      surface area for decorating with various functional ligands. Recently, the metal 
      tin (Sn) has gained huge importance in cancer research owing to its excellent
      cytotoxicity and ability to kill cancer cells. In the present work, we
      synthesized MSNs, conjugated them with organotin compounds, and characterized
      them using various physicochemical techniques. Subsequently, the biological
      evaluation of MSN (S1), MSN-MP (S2) and tin-conjugated MSNs (S3: MSN-MP-SnPh3)
      (MP = 3-mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane) revealed that these nanoconjugates induced
      cytotoxicity, necrosis, and apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Moreover, these
      nanoconjugates exhibited anti-angiogenic properties as demonstrated in the chick 
      embryo model. The increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was found as a one of
      the plausible mechanisms underlying cancer cell cytotoxicity induced by these
      nanoconjugates, encouraging their application for the treatment of cancer. The
      tin-conjugated MSNs demonstrated less toxicity to normal cells compared to cancer
      cells. Furthermore, the genotoxicity studies revealed the clastogenic and
      aneugenic effects of these nanoconjugates in CHO cells mostly at high
      concentrations. These interesting observations are behind the idea of developing 
      tin-conjugated MSNs as prospective candidates for anticancer therapy.

AB  - Bronchial and pleural injuries with persistent air leak pose a threat in the
      repair and regeneration of pulmonary diseases. The need to arrive at a highly
      efficient therapy for closure of bronchopleural fistula (BPF) so as to
      effectively suppress inflammation, infection and repair the damaged pleural space
      caused by cancer as well as contractile restoration of bronchopleural scars
      remain a significant clinical challenge. Herein, we have designed and developed
      potent bioactive vitamin K3 carnosine peptide (VKC)-loaded spun SF fibroin
      fibers/collagen bi-layered 3D scaffold for bronchopleural fistula tissue
      engineering applications. The VKC drug showed excellent cell viability in human
      bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), in addition to its pronounced higher
      cytotoxicity against the A549 lung cancer cell line with an IC50 of 5 mug/mL.
      Furthermore, VKC displayed a strong affinity with the catalytic site of EGFR (PDB
      ID: 1M17) and VEGFR2 (PDB ID: 4AGD, 4ASD) receptors in molecular docking studies.
      Following which the spun SF-VKC (primary layer) and collagen film (top layer)
      constructed bi-layered CSVKC were structurally elucidated and its morphological, 
      physicochemical and biological characterizations were well examined. The
      bi-layered scaffold showed superior biocompatibility and cell migration ability
      in HBECs than other scaffolds. Interestingly, the CSVKC revealed rapid HBECs
      motility towards scratched regions for fast healing in vitro bronchial tissue
      engineering. In vivo biocompatibility and angiogenesis studies of the prepared
      scaffolds were evaluated and the results obtained demonstrated excellent new
      tissue formation and neovascularization in the bi-layered architecture rather
      than others. Therefore, our results suggest that the potent antibacterial and
      anticancer therapeutic agent (VKC)-impregnated silk fibroin fibers/collagen
      bi-layered 3D biomaterial could be useful in treating cancerous BPF and pulmonary
      diseases in future.

AB  - Macroporous scaffolds with bioactivity and magnetic properties can be a good
      candidate for bone regeneration and hyperthermia. In addition, modifying the
      surface of the scaffolds with biocompatible materials can increase their
      potential for in vivo applications. Here, we developed a multifunctional
      nanocomposite Mg2SiO4-CuFe2O4 scaffold for bone regeneration and hyperthermia.
      The surface of scaffold was coated with various concentrations of
      poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB, 1-5% (w/v)). It was observed that 3% (w/v) of P3HB 
      provided a favorable combination of porosity (79 +/- 2.1%) and compressive
      strength (3.2 +/- 0.11 MPa). The hyperthermia potential of samples was assessed
      in the presence of various magnetic fields in vitro. The coated scaffolds showed 
      a lower degradation rate than the un-coated one up to 35 days of soaking in
      simulated biological medium. Due to the porous and specific morphology of P3HB,
      it was found that in vitro bioactivity and cell attachment were increased on the 
      scaffold. Moreover, it was observed that the P3HB coating improved the cell
      viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralization of the scaffold.
      Finally, we studied the bone formation ability of the scaffolds in vivo, and
      implanted the developed scaffold in the rat's femur for 8 weeks. Micro-computed
      tomography results including bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness
      exhibited an improvement in the bone regeneration of the coated scaffold compared
      to the control. The overall results of this study introduce a highly macroporous 
      scaffold with multifunctional performance, noticeable ability in bone
      regeneration, and hyperthermia properties for osteosarcoma.

AB  - Hyperbranched polymers hold great promise in nanomedicine for their controlled
      chemical structures, sizes, multiple terminal groups and enhanced stability than 
      linear amphiphilic polymer assemblies. However, the rational design of
      hyperbranched polymer-based nanomedicine with low toxic materials, selective
      cellular uptake, controlled drug release, as well as real-time drug release
      tracking remains challenging. In this work, a hyperbranched multifunctional
      prodrug HBPSi-SS-HCPT is constructed basing on the nonconventional
      aggregation-induced emission (AIE) featured hyperbranched polysiloxanes (HBPSi). 
      The HBPSi is a biocompatible AIE macromolecule devoid of conjugates, showing a
      high quantum yield of 17.88% and low cytotoxicity. By covalently grafting the
      anticancer drug, 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), to the HBPSi through
      3,3'-dithiodipropionic acid, HBPSi-SS-HCPT is obtained. The HBPSis demonstrate
      obvious AIE features and it turned to aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) after
      grafting HCPT owing to the FRET behavior between HBPSi and HCPT in HBPSi-SS-HCPT.
      In addition to on-demand HCPT release in response to changes in environmental pH 
      and glutathione, a series of in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that
      HBPSi-SS-HCPT exhibits enhanced accumulation in tumor tissues through the
      enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect and preferential cancer cell
      uptake by charge reversal, thus resulting in apoptotic cell death subsequently.
      This newly developed multifunctional HBPSi-SS-HCPT prodrug provides a
      biocompatible strategy for controlled drug delivery, preferential cancer cell
      uptake, on-demand drug release and enhanced antitumor efficacy.

AB  - A new series of theranostic silica materials based on fibrous silica particles
      acting as nanocarriers of two different cytotoxic agents, namely, chlorambucil
      and an organotin metallodrug have been prepared and structurally characterized.
      Besides the combined therapeutic activity, these platforms have been decorated
      with a targeting molecule (folic acid, to selectively target triple negative
      breast cancer) and a molecular imaging agent (Alexa Fluor 647, to enable their
      tracking both in vitro and in vivo). The in vitro behaviour of the
      multifunctional silica systems showed a synergistic activity of the two
      chemotherapeutic agents in the form of an enhanced cytotoxicity against
      MDA-MB-231 cells (triple negative breast cancer) as well as by a higher cell
      migration inhibition. Subsequently, the in vivo applicability of the siliceous
      nanotheranostics was successfully assessed by observing with in vivo optical
      imaging techniques a selective tumour accumulation (targeting ability), a marked 
      inhibition of tumour growth paired to a marked antiangiogenic ability after 13
      days of systemic administration, thus, confirming the enhanced theranostic
      activity. The systemic nanotoxicity was also evaluated by analyzing specific
      biochemical markers. The results showed a positive effect in form of reduced
      cytotoxicity when both chemotherapeutics are administered in combination thanks
      to the fibrous silica nanoparticles. Overall, our results confirm the promising
      applicability of these novel silica-based nanoplatforms as advanced drug-delivery
      systems for the synergistic theranosis of triple negative breast cancer.

AB  - Intestinal stents are a palliative treatment option that solves many shortcomings
      of traditional surgeries for cancer-induced intestinal obstructions. The present 
      review provides an overview of the incidence, clinical manifestations and
      limitations in the treatment of intestinal cancers. The paper also discusses
      material property requirements, indications, complications and the future of
      stent-assisted therapy. The advantages and disadvantages of different materials
      and processing techniques for intestinal stents are reviewed along with new stent
      treatment combinations for colorectal cancer. Challenges that require further
      cooperative studies are also detailed. The future development of intestinal
      stents will depend on innovation in material designs as well as the utilization
      of multi-functional strategies and innovative engineering solutions.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy in which the patient's drug
      resistance is one of the main clinical problems. As 2D cultures do not
      recapitulate the cellular microenvironment, which has a key role in drug
      resistance, there is an urgent need for better biomimetic models. Here, a novel
      3D platform is used to model MM. The semi-solid culture consists of a dynamic
      suspension of microspheres and MM cells, termed as microgel. Microspheres are
      synthesized with acrylic polymers of different sizes, compositions, and
      functionalities (fibronectin or hyaluronic acid). Optimal conditions for the
      platform in terms of agitation speed and microsphere size have been determined.
      With these parameters the system allows good proliferation of the MM cell lines
      RPMI8226, U226, and MM1.S. Interestingly, when used for drug resistance studies, 
      culture of the three MM cell lines in microgels showed close agreement in
      revealing the role of acrylic acid in resistance to anti-MM drugs such as
      dexamethasone and bortezomib. This work presents a unique platform for the in
      vitro modeling of non-solid tumors since it allows keeping non-adherent cells in 
      suspension conditions but in a 3D context that can be easily tuned with different
      functionalizations.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming plays an important role in the development of prostate
      cancer (PCa). However, there are few reports on the effects of nanomaterials as
      vectors on cancer metabolic reprogramming. Herein, a type of nanoparticle with
      good biocompatibility was synthesized by modifying the double-stranded of DNA
      containing a sulfhydryl group on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-dsDNA) 
      through salt-aging conjugation methods. The resultant AuNPs-dsDNA complexes
      possessed low toxicity to PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro. There was also no obvious
      hepatorenal toxicity after intravenous injection of AuNPs-dsDNA complexes in
      vivo, which indicated that these nanoparticles had good biological
      compatibilities. We investigated their biological functions using prostate cancer
      cells. Seahorse assay showed that AuNPs-dsDNA complexes could increase glycolysis
      and glycolysis capacity both in PC3 and DU145 cells. We further detected the
      expression of glycolysis-related genes by qPCR assay, and found that PKM2, PDHA, 
      and LDHA were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics
      revealed that PC (18:2(9Z,12Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)) and PC (18:0/18:2 (9Z,12Z)) levels
      were decreased and inosinic acid level was increased in PC3 cells. Whereas
      (3S,6E,10E)-1,6,10,14-Phytatetraen-3-ol, Plasmenyl-PE 36:5 and Cer (d18:2/18:2)
      were decreased, PE 21:3 and 1-pyrrolidinecarboxaldehyde were increased in DU145
      cells after co-culturing with AuNPs-dsDNA. In summary, we found that AuNPs and
      AuNPs-dsDNA complexes possibly regulate the metabolic reprogramming of cancer
      cells mainly through the lipid metabolic pathways, which could compensate for the
      previously mentioned phenomenon of enhanced glycolysis and glycolysis capacity.
      This will provide an important theoretical basis for our future research on the
      characteristic targeted design of nanomaterials for cancer metabolism.

AB  - In recent years, it has been shown that a combination of different antitumour
      strategies involving distinct therapeutic agents, such as chemical compounds and 
      genetic material, could result in an effective therapeutic activity that is much 
      higher than that obtained by conventionally used individual approaches.
      Therefore, the main goal of this work was to develop a new hybrid nanosystem
      based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles and polymers to efficiently transport
      and deliver drug and plasmid DNA into cancer cells. Moreover, its potential to
      mediate a combinatorial antitumour strategy involving epirubicin and herpes
      simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-TK/GCV) gene therapy was
      evaluated. For this purpose, various cationic polymers were assessed, including
      poly(beta-amino ester) homopolymer, gelatine type A, gelatine type B, and
      poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride) block
      copolymer. The obtained results show that using different polymers leads to
      nanosystems with different physicochemical properties and, consequently,
      different biological activities. The best formulation was obtained for hybrid
      nanosystems coated with PEG-b-PAMA. They demonstrated the ability to cotransport 
      and codeliver an anticancer drug and plasmid DNA and effectively mediate the
      combined antitumour strategy in 2D and 3D tumour cell culture models. In summary,
      we developed a novel silica- and polymer-based nanosystem able to mediate a dual 
      chemotherapeutic and suicide gene therapy strategy with a much higher therapeutic
      effect than that obtained through the use of individual approaches, showing its
      potential for cancer treatment.

AB  - ZnO is an important component in skin-protection products and wound-care
      medicines. However, ZnO's antibacterial activity is moderate. We developed two
      types of ZnO microparticles loading with phthalocyanine-type photosensitizers
      (ZnO/PSs) introducing the photodynamic effects. These photosensitive ZnO
      microparticles exhibited long-term while moderate antimicrobial effects by
      continuously releasing Zn(2+) ions. The antimicrobial efficacies were remarkably 
      enhanced by triggering the photodynamic antimicrobial effects. Compared to the
      sole ZnO which showed non-measurable antimicrobial activity at a concentration of
      10 mg/L, both ZnO/PSs demonstrated antimicrobial rates ranged 99%-99.99% against 
      Escherichia coli, normal and drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In a dorsal
      wound infection mouse model, treatment with ZnO/PSs significantly accelerated the
      wound recovery rates. ZnO/PSs promoted wound healing by a dual effect: 1) the
      release of Zn(2+) ions from ZnO facilitating tissue remodeling; 2) the
      photodynamic effect efficiently eliminates pathogens avoiding infection. Notably,
      ZnO/PSs inherited the high biosafety of ZnO without causing noticeable toxicity
      against erythrocyte and endothelial cells. This study not only provides a highly 
      safe and efficient antimicrobial ZnO material for skin cares and wound
      modulations, but also proposes a strategy to functionalize ZnO materials.

AB  - The increasing cancer morbidity and mortality requires the development of
      high-efficiency and low-toxicity anticancer approaches. In recent years,
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted much attention in cancer therapy due to 
      its non-invasive features and low side effects. Photosensitizer (PS) is one of
      the key factors of PDT, and its successful delivery largely determines the
      outcome of PDT. Although a few PS molecules have been approved for clinical use, 
      PDT is still limited by the low stability and poor tumor targeting capacity of
      PSs. Various nanomaterial systems have shown great potentials in improving PDT,
      such as metal nanoparticles, graphene-based nanomaterials, liposomes,
      ROS-sensitive nanocarriers and supramolecular nanomaterials. The small molecular 
      PSs can be loaded in functional nanomaterials to enhance the PS stability and
      tumor targeted delivery, and some functionalized nanomaterials themselves can be 
      directly used as PSs. Herein, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of 
      PDT, and summarize the recent progress of nanomaterials-based PSs and delivery
      systems in anticancer PDT. In addition, the concerns of nanomaterials-based PDT
      including low tumor targeting capacity, limited light penetration, hypoxia and
      nonspecific protein corona formation are discussed. The possible solutions to
      these concerns are also discussed.

TI  - Silencing LINC00665 inhibits cutaneous melanoma in vitro progression and induces 
      apoptosis via the miR-339-3p/TUBB.
PG  - e24630
LID - 10.1002/jcla.24630 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: LncRNAs are closely related to cutaneous melanoma (CM) tumorigenesis 
      and metastasis, and it can affect the progression of CM by regulating cell
      proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, and other cellular mechanisms.
      This study investigated the role of LINC00665 in CM. METHODS: Expressions of
      LINC00665, miR-339-3p, and tubulin beta chain (TUBB) in CM cells were analyzed by
      qRT-PCR and/or Western blot. The LINC00665/miR-339-3p/TUBB targeting network was 
      predicted by bioinformatics tools, screened out by Venn diagrams and analyzed by 
      Pearson's correlation coefficients, followed by validation via dual-luciferase
      reporter assay and/or pull-down assay. Transfection of siLINC00665 or miR-339-3p 
      inhibitor/mimic was conducted with CM cells whose viability, proliferation,
      migration, invasion, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis were measured by CCK-8
      assay, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, Transwell assay, and flow
      cytometry. The associations of TUBB with tumor biological characteristics and
      other proteins were analyzed by CanserSEA and String, respectively. RESULTS:
      High-expressed LINC00665 was detected in CM cells. Silencing LINC00665 decreased 
      CM cell viability; inhibited colony formation, cell cycle progression, migration 
      and invasion; enhanced apoptosis; and upregulated miR-339-3p. LINC00665 targeted 
      miR-339-3p which targeted TUBB. MiR-339-3p upregulation induced effects similar
      to the LINC00665-silencing-induced effects and could downregulate TUBB, which was
      associated with malignant behaviors and related to other five proteins.
      MiR-339-3p downregulation induced the opposite effects of what miR-339-3p
      upregulation induced, and the miR-339-3p downregulation-induced effects could be 
      reversed by LINC00665 silencing. CONCLUSION: Silencing LINC00665 inhibits in
      vitro CM progression and induces apoptosis via the miR-339-3p/TUBB axis.

TI  - Evidence-based surgical guidelines for treating children with Wilms tumor in
      low-resource settings.
PG  - e29906
LID - 10.1002/pbc.29906 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survival of Wilms tumor (WT) is > 90% in high-resource settings but <
      30% in low-resource settings. Adapting a standardized surgical approach to WT is 
      challenging in low-resource settings, but a local control strategy is crucial to 
      improving outcomes. OBJECTIVE: Provide resource-sensitive recommendations for the
      surgical management of WT. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of PubMed
      and EMBASE through July 7, 2020, and used the GRADE approach to assess evidence
      and recommendations. RECOMMENDATIONS: Initiation of treatment should be
      expedited, and surgery should be done in a high-volume setting. Cross-sectional
      imaging should be done to optimize preoperative planning. For patients with
      typical clinical features of WT, biopsy should not be done before chemotherapy,
      and neoadjuvant chemotherapy should precede surgical resection. Also, resection
      should include a large transperitoneal laparotomy, adequate lymph node sampling, 
      and documentation of staging findings. For WT with tumor thrombus in the inferior
      vena cava, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be given before en bloc resection of
      the tumor and thrombus and evaluation for viable tumor thrombus. For those with
      bilateral WT, neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be given for 6-12 weeks. Neither
      routine use of complex hilar control techniques during nephron-sparing surgery
      nor nephron-sparing resection for unilateral WT with a normal contralateral
      kidney is recommended. When indicated, postoperative radiotherapy should be
      administered within 14 days of surgery. Post-chemotherapy pulmonary
      oligometastasis should be resected when feasible, if local protocols allow
      omission of whole-lung irradiation in patients with nonanaplastic histology stage
      IV WT with pulmonary metastasis without evidence of extrapulmonary metastasis.
      CONCLUSION: We provide evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management
      of WT, considering the benefits/risks associated with limited-resource settings.

TI  - Effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy use on body weight changes in a cohort
      of U.S. veterans living with and without HIV.
LID - 10.1111/hiv.13366 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: People living with HIV have high rates of obesity and obesity-related 
      comorbidities. Our study sought to evaluate weight trajectory in a retrospective 
      cohort of people living with HIV and matched HIV-negative veterans (controls) and
      to evaluate risk factors for weight gain. METHODS: This was a retrospective
      database analysis of data extracted from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse that
      included people living with HIV (n = 22 421) and age-matched HIV-negative
      controls (n = 63 072). The main outcomes were baseline body weight and weight
      change from baseline at 1, 2, and 5 years after diagnosis (baseline visit for
      controls). RESULTS: Body weight at baseline was lower in people living with HIV
      than in controls. People living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) gained
      more weight than did controls. In a sub-analysis of ART-exposed people living
      with HIV, age >50 years, African American race, body mass index (BMI) <25, CD4
      </=200, and HIV diagnosis year after 2000 were associated with more weight gain
      at year 1. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) plus non-NRTIs
      (NNRTIs) were associated with less weight gain than NRTIs plus protease
      inhibitors, NRTIs plus integrase inhibitors, or NRTIs plus other agents at year
      1. CONCLUSIONS: Among US veterans, those living with HIV had lower rates of
      obesity than age-matched HIV-negative controls; however, primarily in the first 2
      years after starting ART, people living with HIV gained more weight than did
      controls.

TI  - AATF/Che-1 localizes to paraspeckles and suppresses R-loops accumulation and
      interferon activation in Multiple Myeloma.
PG  - e109711
LID - 10.15252/embj.2021109711 [doi]
AB  - Several kinds of stress promote the formation of three-stranded RNA:DNA hybrids
      called R-loops. Insufficient clearance of these structures promotes genomic
      instability and DNA damage, which ultimately contribute to the establishment of
      cancer phenotypes. Paraspeckle assemblies participate in R-loop resolution and
      preserve genome stability, however, the main determinants of this mechanism are
      still unknown. This study finds that in Multiple Myeloma (MM), AATF/Che-1
      (Che-1), an RNA-binding protein fundamental to transcription regulation,
      interacts with paraspeckles via the lncRNA NEAT1_2 (NEAT1) and directly localizes
      on R-loops. We systematically show that depletion of Che-1 produces a marked
      accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids. We provide evidence that such failure to resolve
      R-loops causes sustained activation of a systemic inflammatory response
      characterized by an interferon (IFN) gene expression signature. Furthermore,
      elevated levels of R-loops and of mRNA for paraspeckle genes in patient cells are
      linearly correlated with Multiple Myeloma progression. Moreover, increased
      interferon gene expression signature in patients is associated with markedly poor
      prognosis. Taken together, our study indicates that Che-1/NEAT1 cooperation
      prevents excessive inflammatory signaling in Multiple Myeloma by facilitating the
      clearance of R-loops. Further studies on different cancer types are needed to
      test if this mechanism is ubiquitously conserved and fundamental for cell
      homeostasis.

AB  - Background: Forkhead box F2, a member of the Forkhead box transcription factor
      superfamily, plays an important role in several types of cancer. However, the
      mechanisms of Forkhead box F2 in the progression of colorectal cancer remain
      unclear. PRUNE2 is closely associated with prostate cancer, neuroblastoma,
      glioblastoma, and melanoma. The relationship between Forkhead box F2 and PRUNE2
      in colorectal cancer remains unknown. Method: We investigated the effects of
      Forkhead box F2 upregulation on colorectal cancer cell behavior in vitro using
      Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, Transwell, reverse
      transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses.
      Nude mouse xenografts were established to investigate the effect of Forkhead box 
      F2 upregulation on the growth of colorectal cancer cells. Dual-luciferase
      reporter assays were performed to confirm the Forkhead box F2 regulation of
      PRUNE2 transcription. A series of in vitro assays was performed in cells with
      Forkhead box F2 upregulation and PRUNE2 knockdown to elucidate the function and
      regulatory effects of Forkhead box F2 on PRUNE2 transcription in colorectal
      cancer. Results: Forkhead box F2 was downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues
      compared with adjacent tissues. Forkhead box F2 overexpression significantly
      suppressed the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells in vitro and
      in vivo. Moreover, Forkhead box F2 directly targeted PRUNE2 to promote its
      transcription in colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, PRUNE2 mediated the
      Forkhead box F2-regulated proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. 
      Additionally, we demonstrated a significant positive correlation between Forkhead
      box F2 and PRUNE2 mRNA levels in colorectal cancer tissues. Conclusion: These
      results indicated that Forkhead box F2 and PRUNE2 in combination may serve as a
      prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer and that Forkhead box F2 upregulation 
      inhibits the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by
      upregulating PRUNE2.

AB  - Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common 
      cancer worldwide. Heat shock protein 90 alpha family class B member 1 (HSP90AB1) 
      is highly expressed in a variety of cancers and is associated with poor
      prognosis, however, its role in HNSCC is still poorly understood. This study
      aimed to explore the function HSP90AB1 played in HNSCC progression. Methods: The 
      expression level of HSP90AB1 in HNSCC was analyzed by bioinformatics analysis and
      western blotting, and its relationship with clinicopathological parameters was
      analyzed by bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry. Three stable
      HSP90AB1 knockdown HNSCC cell lines were constructed by lentiviral transfection. 
      The effect of HSP90AB1 knockdown on the proliferation and migration of HNSCC
      cells was tested by CCK-8 assay, EdU incorporation assay, colony formation assay,
      nude mouse xenograft models, transwell migration assay, wound healing assay, and 
      western blotting. The effect of HSP90AB1 knockdown on glycolysis in HNSCC cells
      was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and related assay kits. Finally, the
      levels of Akt and phospho-Akt (Ser473) proteins after HSP90AB1 knockdown were
      detected by western blotting. Results: HSP90AB1 was highly expressed in HNSCC and
      associated with T grade, lymph node metastasis, and prognosis. Knockdown of
      HSP90AB1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and glycolysis of HNSCC, and
      reduced the level of phospho-Akt. Conclusion: HSP90AB1 functions as an oncogene
      in HNSCC, and has the potential to become a prognostic factor and therapeutic
      target.

TI  - Downregulation of TRIM33 Promotes Survival and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition 
      in Gastric Cancer.
PG  - 15330338221114505
LID - 10.1177/15330338221114505 [doi]
AB  - Among all malignancies worldwide, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer 
      with the third highest mortality rate. One of the main reasons for the low
      survival rate is the recurrence and metastasis that occurs in many patients after
      surgery. Numerous studies have shown that abnormal TRIM33 expression is
      associated with the progression of malignant tumors. TRIM33 can function either
      as a tumor suppressor or tumor promoter in different cancers. Our data showed
      that TRIM33 was highly expressed in stomach cancer, and in human gastric cancer
      tissues, low expression of TRIM33 was associated with poor prognosis in patients 
      with gastric cancer. To clarify the function of TRIM33 in survival and
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells, we investigated the
      effect of TRIM33 knockdown in several gastric cancer cell lines. Downregulation
      of TRIM33 in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells enhanced the proliferation, colony
      formation, and migratory ability of these gastric cancer cells. It also promoted 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition; transfection of cells with siRNA targeting
      TRIM33 led to the upregulation of vimentin and N-Cadherin expression, and
      downregulation of E-Cadherin expression. Meanwhile, the transforming growth
      factor beta pathway was activated: levels of transforming growth factor beta were
      elevated and the expressions of p-Smad2, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 were activated. 
      To confirm the role of TRIM33 in vivo, a xenograft model was established in nude 
      mice. Immunohistochemical analysis identified that the protein levels of TRIM33, 
      p-Smad2, Smad2, Smad3, Smad4, vimentin, and N-Cadherin were increased, and
      E-Cadherin levels were decreased, in xenograft tumors from the si-TRIM33 group.
      Taken together, these results suggest that TRIM33 may be a potential marker for
      the diagnosis and prognosis of gastric cancer. Furthermore, it may also serve as 
      a novel target for gastric cancer treatment.

TI  - High COL10A1 expression potentially contributes to poor outcomes in gastric
      cancer with the help of LEF1 and Wnt2.
PG  - e24612
LID - 10.1002/jcla.24612 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: COL10A1 is a secreted, short-chain collagen found in several types of
      cancer. Studies have shown that COL10A1 aberrant expression is considered an
      oncogenic factor. However, its underlying mechanisms and regulation of gastric
      cancer remain undefined. METHODS: The data on the expression of COL10A1,
      clinicopathological characteristics, and outcome of patients with GC were
      obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The ALGGEN-PROMO database defined the
      related transcription factors. Quantitative real-time reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting analysis were used
      to identify the differential expression levels of COL10A1 and related
      transcription factors. RESULTS: We found that high COL10A1 expression is an
      independent risk factor for gastric cancer. Upregulation of LEF1 and Wnt2 was
      also observed in gastric cancer, suggesting a potential correlation between
      LEF1/COL10A1 regulation in the Wnt2 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: High COL10A1
      expression may contribute to poor outcomes via upregulation of LEF1 and Wnt2 in
      gastric cancer.

TI  - A Prognostic Nomogram for Predicting Overall Survival in Patients With Small-Cell
      Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix: A SEER Population-Based Study.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to develop a prognostic model based on the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to predict the
      overall survival (OS) of small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (SmCC).
      Methods: Between 1975 and 2016, a total of 401 patients were included, and their 
      comprehensive sociodemographic and clinicopathological characteristics were
      collected. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to screen 
      for independent prognostic factors. The identified factors were used to conduct a
      nomogram for predicting the OS of SmCC. The performance of the nomogram was
      determined using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC),
      concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA)
      metrics. Results: The median survival time of all patients was about 24 months
      (95% confidence interval [95% CI] [1.50-2.17]). Age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.693
      for 45-59 vs 21-34, 95% CI [1.140-2.513], P = .009; HR = 2.836 for 60-92 vs
      21-34, 95% CI [1.851-4.345], P < .001), positive nodes (HR = 2.384, 95% CI
      [1.437-3.955], P < .001), regional nodes number >/=12 (HR = 0.500, 95% CI
      [0.282-0.886], P = .018), and treatment method (HR = 0.409 for surgery vs no, 95%
      CI [0.267-0.628], P < .001; HR = 0.649 for chemotherapy vs no, 95% CI
      [0.478-0.881)], P = .006) were independent factors of OS. Young patients who had 
      surgical resection or chemotherapy, negative lymph nodes, and regional lymph
      nodes >/=12 had a longer survival time. These clinical factors were utilized to
      construct a nomogram for predicting OS. The AUC and C-index were higher than 0.7,
      indicating the good discriminating ability of the nomogram. The calibrations were
      all around the 45-degree line, indicating excellent consistency between the
      prediction of the model and actual observations. The DCA plots supported the
      clinical utility of the nomogram. Conclusion: The constructed nomogram is
      expected to help predict the prognosis of SmCC and guide patient treatment.

TI  - Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) Combined With Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal
      Chemotherapy (HIPEC) for Platinum-Sensitive Recurrence Epithelial Ovarian Cancer 
      With HRR Mutation: A Phase III Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 15330338221104565
LID - 10.1177/15330338221104565 [doi]
AB  - Background: Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains the leading cause of
      gynecologic cancer death worldwide due to the high recurrence rate. Cytoreductive
      surgery (CRS) combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is 
      an alternative modality for platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC. The latest studies 
      demonstrate homologous recombination-related (HRR) mutation status increases the 
      sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy drugs in EOC. However, the molecular
      analysis of recurrent EOC patient benefits from HIPEC is unknown. Thus, we aimed 
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CRS combined with HIPEC for
      platinum-sensitive in recurrent EOC with HRR mutation. Methods: This is a phase
      III randomized controlled clinical trial in patients with platinum-sensitive
      recurrent EOC. Participants were divided into 2 groups based on the HRR mutation 
      status and randomized to receive CRS + HIPEC. The patients then received periodic
      chemotherapy and follow-up. Results: The primary objective of this study was to
      evaluate the effect of CRS + HIPEC compared to CRS alone in patients with a
      platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC stratified for HRD status. We hypothesize that
      the addition of HIPEC to CRS improves the progression-free survival (PFS) of
      platinum-sensitive recurrent EOC patients with HRR mutation compared with
      patients without HRR mutation. Conclusion: Recurrent EOC has a poor prognosis due
      to implantation and metastasis in the abdominal cavity. Intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy reduced seeding by removing free tumor cells. HIPEC utilizes
      physical and biological properties to significantly increase the clearance rate
      of tumors. Van Driel WJ et al proposed that HIPEC using platinum-based
      chemotherapy improves the survival of patients with ovarian cancer. HRR mutation,
      as a common pathogenic mutation in ovarian cancer, has a predictive effect on the
      platinum sensitivity of ovarian cancer patients. Whether lobaplatin-based HIPEC
      will play a greater role in ovarian cancer patients with HRR mutations is
      currently unknown.

AB  - BCL10, a key activator of NF-kappaB downstream of oncogenic B-cell receptor
      signaling, is mutated in nearly 40% of the BN2/C1 genetic subtype of diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma, but how these mutations function to augment signaling and 
      their relevance to targeted precision medicine agents remains unclear. In this
      issue of Cancer Discovery, Xia and colleagues demonstrate distinct mechanisms of

TI  - Assessment of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and its associated factors among
      cervical cancer patients in the leading tertiary hospital in Kenya.
PG  - 10781552221119417
LID - 10.1177/10781552221119417 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cisplatin is the widely used antineoplastic agent in managing
      cervical cancer despite nephrotoxicity being a major concern. In addition, there 
      was a paucity of data about the degree of nephrotoxicity due to cisplatin in the 
      study setting. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of
      cisplatin nephrotoxicity among cervical patients. METHODS: A retrospective
      cross-sectional study was conducted at the Cancer Treatment Centre of Kenyatta
      National Hospital among 100 cervical cancer patients treated with a cisplatin
      regimen. Simple random sampling was employed to the recruit medical record of
      patients. This study used a data abstraction tool to extract the patients'
      relevant socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The data were analysed
      using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25.0 software. Frequency
      tables and figures were used to present the findings of the study. Binary
      logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with
      cisplatin nephrotoxicity. RESULTS: The study showed a mean age of 52.09 +/- 10.44
      years. The prevalence rate of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in cervical cancer
      patients was 45%. Of these patients, 36% and 9% patients had grade 1 and 2
      nephrotoxicities, respectively. Comorbidities (crude odd's ratio (COR) = 3.05,
      95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-7.02, p = 0.011), hypertension (COR = 3.0, 95%
      CI = 1.1-7.8, p = 0.03), and more than three cycles of cisplatin treatment
      (adjusted odd's ratio = 4.5, 95% CI = 1.19-17.0, p = 0.027) were significant
      factors of nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of cisplatin-induced
      nephrotoxicity among cervical cancer patients was high in the study setting.
      Comorbidities, number of cycles and types of comorbidities were significant
      factors associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity.

      of lymph node status in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer (EC).
      Intraoperative detection of SLNs is based on the results obtained from
      preoperative nuclear medical images. The purpose of this study was to compare the
      data obtained from planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL), single-photon emission
      computed tomography (SPECT), and SPECT with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) for
      preoperative SLN detection in patients with EC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 
      44 images in 22 patients with early-stage EC (22 PL, 9 SPECT and 13 SPECT/CT)
      were analyzed. The scans were performed in the period 2018-2020 at the Institute 
      of Pathophysiology and Nuclear Medicine in Skopje. Thirteen patients underwent PL
      and SPECT/CT and nine patients underwent PL and SPECT after cervical injection of
      4 mCi 99mTc-SENTI-SCINT on the day of surgery. Descriptive statistics, Wilcoxon
      Matched Pairs Test, and Spearman rank R coefficient were used for data analyses. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with mean age of 61.1 +/- 7.5 and body mass index
      (BMI) 34.62 +/- 6.4 kg/m2 were included in the study. In four patients (18.2%)
      SLN was not detected on PL. Detection rate on SPECT and SPECT/CT was 100%. The
      average number of detected SLN was 1.4 +/- 1.05, 2.2 +/- 1.1 small i, Cyrillic
      2.15 +/- 1.1 on PL, SPECT and SPECT/CT respectively. We found a statistically
      significant difference in the number of detected SLNs on PL vs SPECT/CT (p =
      0.0077). The most common SLN location on SPECT/CT was the right internal iliac
      followed by the left common iliac region. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the
      presented study indicate a higher diagnostic value of SPECT/CT in terms of SLN
      detection and exact anatomic localization as compared to planar
      lymphoscintigraphy (PL).

AB  - OBJECTIVE(S): For patients with cancer, the emergence of acute palliative care
      units (APCU) may hold promise in curtailing hospital readmissions. The study aims
      to describe the characteristics of patients readmitted to an APCU. METHODS: This 
      retrospective study examined patients with cancer readmitted within 30 days to an
      APCU. Readmissions were further classified as either potentially preventable or
      non-preventable. RESULTS: Out of 734 discharges from July 1, 2014 to July 1,
      2015, 69 (9%) readmissions were identified and analyzed. For index admissions,
      median length of stay was five days, and one (1%) was discharged home with
      hospice care. For readmissions, median time from index admission to readmission
      was nine days, median length of stay was six days, three (4%) patients died, and 
      20 (30%) went home with hospice. Ten (14.5%) readmissions were deemed potentially
      preventable (95% CI 7.2-25.0%). Race/ethnicity-White/Black/Hispanic/Others-was
      60%, 10%, 20% and 10%, respectively, among potentially preventable readmissions
      and 76%, 22%, 2% and 0%, respectively, among potentially non-preventable
      readmissions (P = .012). Potentially preventable readmissions were more likely to
      have venous thromboembolism (40% vs. 12%, P = .046) and more reasons for
      readmission (median 2 vs. 1, P = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with cancer
      readmitted to an APCU, one out of seven was potentially preventable and a far
      larger proportion was discharged with hospice care compared to the index
      admission. Recognition of disease course, meaningful goals of care discussions
      and timely transition to hospice care may reduce rehospitalization in this
      population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cyclin-dependent-kinase 4/6(CDK4/6) inhibitors are widely used as a
      first-line systemic treatment for patients with hormone receptor-positive, human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative metastatic breast cancer. Although
      many patients with metastatic breast cancer require palliative radiotherapy (RT),
      there are limited data on the safety of combining a CDK4/6 inhibitor with
      palliative RT. CASE REPORT: Presented is a case of acute high-grade radiation
      dermatitis with low-dose palliative RT following administration of palbociclib. A
      49-year-old woman with newly diagnosed hormone receptor-positive invasive ductal 
      carcinoma of the left breast presented with lytic bone lesions in the left femur 
      and lumbar spine. The patient initiated treatment with goserelin, tamoxifen, and 
      palbociclib. She underwent prophylactic surgical fixation of the left femur and
      received post-operative RT encompassing the entire surgical nail (30 Gy/10
      fractions) and palliative RT to the lumbar spine for pain relief (20 Gy/5
      fractions). During cycle 4, palbociclib was stopped 3 days prior to the start of 
      RT to reduce the risk of toxicity risk. However, 16 days after starting RT, she
      developed painful erythematous papules and bullae with moist desquamation on the 
      left groin and lumbar spine. MANAGEMENT & OUTCOME: Her symptoms were managed with
      topical Aquaphor-lidocaine, silver sulfadiazine, and aluminum acetate soaks.
      Dermatitis subsided to dry desquamation within 2 weeks. The patient denied late
      toxicity at 11 months follow-up. DISCUSSION: Larger retrospective or prospective 
      studies are needed to further elucidate the safety of combined CDK4/6 inhibitors 
      and RT. In the meantime, special precautions are warranted in patients receiving 
      combined therapy.

      with a rare cerebral appendiceal carcinoma metastasis, a case that is further
      remarkable for representing the first histologic diagnosis of primary medullary
      carcinoma in the appendix. Based on a comprehensive review of the English

      cerebral appendiceal metastases have been described.

PG  - 190-194
LID - 10.14791/btrt.2022.0020 [doi]
AB  - Radiation-induced cavernous hemangiomas (RICHs) have been increasingly reported
      as a late complication after conventional radiotherapy. RICH after stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) is extremely rare and the few cases have been reported to
      demonstrate their properties. A 72-year-old female patient presented with
      progressive neurologic deficits. She underwent tumor surgery for meningioma 13
      years ago and two times of SRS for treating a residual tumor. Newly-developed
      mass was 4.3 cm-sized heterogeneously enhancing mass with severe cerebral edema. 
      She underwent surgical resection and the histologic examinations revealed
      organized hematoma. Finally, it was diagnosed as a RICH following SRS based on
      radiological and histological findings and a history of multiple radiosurgeries. 
      Clinical, radiological, and histological features of a RICH following SRS were
      discussed in this report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are numerous factors to consider in deciding whether to undergo
      surgical treatment for brain metastasis from lung cancer. Herein, we aimed to
      analyze the survival outcome and predictors of recurrence of surgically treated
      brain metastasis from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A total of 197
      patients with brain metastasis from NSCLC who underwent microsurgery were
      included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 114 (57.9%) male and 83 (42.1%)
      female patients with a median age of 59 years (range, 27-79) was included in this
      study. The median follow-up period was 22.7 (range, 1-126) months. The 1-year and
      2-year overall survival (OS) rates of patients with brain metastasis secondary to
      NSCLC were 59% and 43%, respectively. The 6-month and 1-year progression-free
      survival (PFS) rates of local recurrence were 80% and 73%, respectively, whereas 
      those of distant recurrence were 84% and 63%, respectively. En-bloc resection of 
      tumor resulted in better PFS for local recurrence (1-year PFS: 79% vs. 62%,
      p=0.02). Ventricular opening and direct contact between the tumor and the
      subarachnoid space were not associated with distal recurrence and leptomeningeal 
      seeding. The difference in PFS of local recurrence according to adjuvant
      resection bed irradiation was not significant. Moreover, postoperative
      whole-brain irradiation did not show a significant difference in PFS of distant
      recurrence. In multivariate analysis, only en-bloc resection was a favorable
      prognostic factor for local recurrence. Contrastingly, multiple metastasis was a 
      poor prognostic factor for distant recurrence. CONCLUSION: En-bloc resection may 
      reduce local recurrence after surgical resection. Ventricular opening and contact
      between the tumor and subarachnoid space did not show a statistically significant
      result for distant recurrence and leptomeningeal seeding. Multiple metastasis was
      only meaningful factor for distant recurrence.

AB  - Brain metastasis (BM), classified as a secondary brain tumor, is the most common 
      malignant central nervous system tumor whose median overall survival is
      approximately 6 months. However, the survival rate of patients with BMs has
      increased with recent advancements in immunotherapy and targeted therapy. This
      means that clinicians should take a more active position in the treatment
      paradigm that passively treats BMs. Because patients with BM are treated in a
      variety of clinical settings, treatment planning requires a more sophisticated
      decision-making process than that for other primary malignancies. Therefore, an
      accurate prognostic prediction is essential, for which a graded prognostic
      assessment that reflects next-generation sequencing can be helpful. It is also
      essential to understand the indications for various treatment modalities, such as
      surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, and whole-brain radiotherapy and
      consider their advantages and disadvantages when choosing a treatment plan.
      Surgical resection serves a limited auxiliary function in BM, but it can be an
      essential therapeutic approach for increasing the survival rate of specific
      patients; therefore, this must be thoroughly recognized during the treatment
      process. The ultimate goal of surgical resection is maximal safe resection; to
      this end, neuronavigation, intraoperative neuro-electrophysiologic assessment
      including evoked potential, and the use of fluorescent materials could be
      helpful. In this review, we summarize the considerations for neurosurgical
      treatment in a rapidly changing treatment environment.

      Gliomas.

AB  - Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been a mainstay of cancer treatment since the 1940s.
      In the recent era of emergent targeted therapies and immunotherapies, many
      cytotoxic chemotherapy agents including temozolomide are still one of main
      weapons for the treatment of high grade gliomas. However, cytotoxic chemotherapy 
      often causes side effects. Proper management of chemotherapy-induced toxicity can
      have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life and clinical outcomes.
      Many supportive care advances have transformed our ability to give full doses of 
      chemotherapy, which is important for achieving their full efficacy. Prevention
      and treatment strategies have been developed for many chemotherapy-related
      toxicities. This review focused on managing gastrointestinal toxicity,
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and hematologic toxicities such as
      thrombocytopenia during cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment in high-grade brain
      tumors.

AB  - Over the last two decades, numerous studies have investigated the presence of
      human cytomegalovirus (CMV) within glioblastoma or gliomas; however, the results 
      are severely conflicting. While a few researchers have suggested the potential
      benefits of cytotoxic T lymphocyte or dendritic cell-based vaccines for recurrent
      or newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients, several studies did not at all agree
      with the existence of CMV in glioblastoma cells. In this review, we summarized
      the conflicting results and issues about the detection of CMV in glioblastoma or 
      glioma patients. We also provided the clinical data of published and unpublished 
      clinical trials using CMV-specific immunotherapy for glioblastomas.

TI  - Effect of irradiation on cytokine production in cancer patients.
PG  - 3936155221116388
LID - 10.1177/03936155221116388 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irradiation, which affects cytokine secretion, is used to treat
      cancer patients. Cytokine levels have correlations to disease parameters, serving
      as biomarkers for patients. We aim to explore the effect of irradiation on
      cytokine production both in vitro (using lymphocytes from healthy donors) and in 
      vivo (using serum levels of head and neck cancer patients following irradiation) 
      and correlating them to mucositis severity/need for percutaneous endoscopic
      gastroscopy (PEG) tube installation. METHODS: Cytokine production by cultured
      lymphocytes from healthy donors, in vitro, following irradiation of 5 or 10 Gy.
      In addition, blood from 23 patients with head and neck cancers, irradiated by
      60-72G in vivo, were assessed for inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-18), the anti-inflammatory cytokine
      IL-10, and the general marker sIL-2R. Following radiation, selected patients who 
      were developing mucositis were treated by PEG tube installation. Changes in
      cytokine levels were studied as predictive biomarkers of response to therapy/PEG 
      tube installation. Cytokine production levels were measured using ELISAs kits.
      RESULTS: Irradiation decreased the levels of all tested cytokines, most notably
      IL-6 and IL-8, proportional to irradiation dose. In patients, increases in
      cytokine levels, correlated with mucositis severity and potentially the need for 
      PEG tube installation. CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation decreased the levels of all
      cytokines of healthy lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner, especially those of 
      IL-6 and IL-8. This study shows a correlation between high and increasing levels 
      of inflammatory cytokines, sIL-2R, plus radiation toxicity and the need for PEG. 
      The reduction of cytokine levels after radiotherapy predicts that PEG will not be
      required. Thus, our study shows that cytokine changes are predictive biomarkers
      in head and neck cancer patients.

      including demographic profile (age and sex), clinical presentation, disease
      characteristics (disease behavior and severity, extent of disease), and treatment
      were recorded and compared with adult-onset IBD. Results: During the study
      period, 3,922 (3,172 ulcerative colitis [UC] and 750 Crohn's disease [CD])
      patients with IBD were recorded in the database. A total of 186 patients (4.74%; 
      116 males [62.36%]) had elderly-onset IBD (69.35% UC and 30.64% CD). Diarrhea,
      blood in stools, nocturnal frequency and pain abdomen were the commonest
      presentations for UC, whereas pain abdomen, weight loss and diarrhea were the
      most frequent symptoms in CD. For both elderly onset UC and CD, majority of the
      patients had moderately severe disease. Left-sided colitis was the commonest
      disease location in UC. Isolated ileal disease and inflammatory behavior were the
      most common disease location and behavior, respectively in CD. 5-Aminosalicylates
      were the commonest prescribed drug for both elderly onset UC and CD. Thiopurines 
      and biologics were used infrequently. Prevalence of colorectal cancer was higher 
      in elderly onset IBD. Conclusions: Elderly onset IBD is not uncommon in India.
      Both the elderly onset UC and CD were milder, with no significant differences in 
      disease characteristics (disease extent, location and behavior) when compared to 
      adult-onset IBD. Colorectal cancer was more common in elderly onset IBD.

TI  - It was the best of times, it was the worst of times: A tale of two cities-Beijing
      and Shanghai-Why the divergent COVID-19 control outcomes?

AB  - COVID-19 both creates and complicates public health challenges. Yet the pandemic 
      also provides a unique lens for dissecting complex issues in global health that
      could benefit society in the long run. In this paper, we discuss the underlying
      reasons that can help explain the divergent COVID-19 control outcomes between
      Beijing and Shanghai-two advanced metropolitans that are similar in their
      municipal capacity, administrative capability and pandemic strategy. We hope
      insights of this investigation contribute to the development of disease
      prevention systems, such as context-specific and data-driven public health
      strategies that could yield optimal pandemic control outcomes with minimal
      unintended consequences, both amid and beyond COVID-19.

TI  - Long-Term Health Outcomes of Early Menarche in Women: An Umbrella Review.
LID - hcac187 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/qjmed/hcac187 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited comprehensive evidence on the potential association 
      between early menarche and subsequent health outcomes. AIM: To evaluate the
      existing evidence for the association of early menarche with later health
      outcomes and assess the strength and validity of the evidence for these
      associations. DESIGN: Umbrella review. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of
      Science, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google
      Scholar, and manually screened retrieved references to find systematic reviews
      and meta-analyses from inception to July 2021. Early menarche was defined taking 
      into account the ethnicity and birth year, and the outcomes were long-term
      consequences in adulthood. RESULTS: Thirteen reviews encompassing 283 original
      articles and over 6.8 million participants from 39 countries across five
      continents were included. In categorical outcomes, early menarche was associated 
      with metabolic syndrome (n = 37,543, pooled adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.56,
      95% CI 1.33-1.83; high certainty [Hi]), endometrial cancer (n = 874,188, aRR
      1.40, 95% CI 1.17-1.68; Hi), type 2 diabetes mellitus/impaired glucose tolerance 
      (n = 1,185,444, aRR 1.30, 95% CI 1.19-1.42; Hi), breast cancer (n = 103,574, aRR 
      1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.33; Hi), death from all causes (n = 152,747, aRR 1.11, 95% CI
      1.03-1.19; Hi), obesity (n = 54,006, aRR 1.68, 95% CI 1.53-1.84; moderate
      certainty [Mod]), gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 48,535, aRR 1.32, 95% CI
      1.09-1.58; Mod), hypertension (n = 1,682,689, aRR 1.24, 95% CI 1.20-1.29; Mod),
      endometriosis (n = 885,390, aRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.09-1.37; Mod), ovarian cancer (n =
      1,022,451, aRR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.31; Mod), and asthma (n = 22,859, aRR 1.31,
      95% CI 1.09-1.57; low certainty [Lo]). For continuous outcomes, early menarche
      was associated with increased BMI in adults >/=40 years of age (n = 121,943,
      adjusted pooled standardized mean difference [aSMD] 0.30, 95% CI 0.28-0.32; Mod),
      BMI in adults <40 years of age (n = 124,728, aSMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.36-0.43; Mod),
      serum fasting insulin level (n = 17,020, aSMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.48-0.57; Mod), and
      homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (n = 7,925, aSMD 0.27, 95% CI 
      0.19-0.35; Mod). CONCLUSION: We found varied levels of evidence for the
      association between early menarche and the development of subsequent health
      problems. Our results recommend that physicians should pay attention to these
      associations, as early menarche can be a potential indicator of metabolic
      disorders and female-specific cancer and cause death in women.

TI  - Major surgical postoperative complications and survival in breast cancer: Swedish
      population-based register study in 57 152 women.
LID - znac275 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znac275 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative complications may activate prometastatic systemic
      pathways through tissue damage, wound healing, infection, and inflammation.
      Postoperative complications are associated with inferior survival in several
      types of cancer. The aim was to determine the association between postoperative
      complications and survival in breast cancer. METHODS: This population-based
      cohort included women operated for T1-3 N0-3 M0 invasive breast cancer in Sweden 
      from 2008 to 2017. Only major surgical postoperative complications leading to
      readmission and/or reoperation within 30 days were considered. Main outcomes were
      overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). Prospectively
      collected nationwide register data were used. Multivariable Cox models were
      adjusted for clinical and socioeconomic confounders and co-morbidity. RESULTS:
      Among 57 152 women, major surgical postoperative complications were registered
      for 1854 patients. Median follow-up was 6.22 (0.09-11.70) years. Overall, 9163
      patients died, and 3472 died from breast cancer. Major surgical postoperative
      complications were more common after mastectomy with or without immediate
      reconstruction (7.3 and 4.3 per cent respectively) than after breast-conserving
      surgery (2.3 per cent). Unadjusted 5-year OS and BCSS rates were 82.6 (95 per
      cent c.i. 80.8 to 84.5) and 92.1 (90.8 to 93.5) per cent respectively for women
      with a major surgical postoperative complication, and 88.8 (88.6 to 89.1) and
      95.0 (94.8 to 95.2) per cent for those without a complication (P < 0.001). After 
      adjustment, all-cause and breast cancer mortality rates remained higher after a
      major surgical postoperative complication (OS: HR 1.32, 95 per cent c.i. 1.15 to 
      1.51; BCSS: HR 1.31, 1.04 to 1.65). After stratification for type of breast
      surgery, this association remained significant only for women who had mastectomy 
      without reconstruction (OS: HR 1.41, 1.20 to 1.66; BCSS: HR 1.36, 1.03 to 1.79). 
      CONCLUSION: Major surgical postoperative complications are associated with
      inferior survival, especially after mastectomy. These results underline the
      importance of surgical de-escalation.

AB  - We established a multidisciplinary early childhood clinic to support infants and 
      toddlers receiving cancer treatment. The access to occupational therapy (OT) in
      this population is unknown. To describe the access to OT for infants and toddlers
      with cancer. We retrospectively reviewed medical records to determine the
      frequency and characteristics of children with cancer who were referred to OT.
      Demographic data, medical information, and frequency of referrals were extracted 
      from September 2015 to September 2018. Of the 134 patients, 112 (83.6%) received 
      an OT evaluation: 88.4% were referred for hospital-based OT services; 42.0% were 
      recommended for services upon returning home. Between-group comparisons revealed 
      significant differences in referrals for home- or community-based OT services
      based on age and disease. OT is crucial to treatment plans that address the
      developmental needs of young pediatric oncology patients during hospitalization
      and thereafter. Recommendations for monitoring this vulnerable population are
      provided.

LID - 10.1177/21501319221116231 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that
      liver disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US,
      afflicting 4.5 million people in 2018, or approximately 1.7% of the American
      adult population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and risk factors
      associated with liver disease among older Mexican Americans over 18 years of
      follow-up. METHODS: Non-institutionalized Mexican Americans aged >/=67 years (N =
      1938) from the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the
      Elderly (1995/96-2012/13) were studied. Measures included socio-demographic
      variables, self-reported liver disease, language of interview, medical
      conditions, hand-grip strength, physical and cognitive function, depressive
      symptoms, and body mass index. Generalized estimating equation models were used
      to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of liver disease over
      time. RESULTS: The mean age at baseline was 74.9 +/- 6.0 years and 58.4% were
      female. The prevalence of liver disease ranged from 2.4% to 8.4%. Over time, the 
      odds ratio of reporting liver disease was 1.17 (CI = 1.12-1.22). Older age,
      Spanish interview, arthritis, diabetes, heart failure, cancer, and high scores on
      the Mini-Mental-State-Examination were factors associated with greater odds of
      reporting liver disease over time. Married participants reported lower odds of
      liver disease over time. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of liver disease in this
      population was high, ranging from 2.4% to 8.4%. Diabetes, heart failure,
      arthritis, and cancer were risk factors for liver disease. Screening for liver
      function among patients with these morbidities may help prevent liver disease in 
      this population with high rates of diabetes and obesity.

TI  - Dissemination of an evidence-based behavioral intervention to alleviate distress 
      in caregivers of children recently diagnosed with cancer: Bright IDEAS.
PG  - e29904
LID - 10.1002/pbc.29904 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Four multisite randomized clinical trials of > 1400 caregivers of
      children newly diagnosed with cancer showed that the Bright IDEAS (BI) paradigm
      of problem-solving skills training is an acceptable and efficacious approach to
      alleviating the high levels of distress they experience. To facilitate providing 
      evidence-based caregiver support as recommended in the pediatric oncology
      standards of care, the project described here was designed to disseminate BI to
      200 psychosocial professionals. PROCEDURE: We partnered with the Children's
      Oncology Group (COG), Association of Pediatric Oncology Social Workers (APOSW),
      Association of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nurses (APHON), and special interest
      group in pediatric hematology/oncology of the Society for Pediatric Psychology
      (SPP). Membership surveys revealed substantial enthusiasm for training in BI. We 
      structured training to include review of the evidence base for BI, role plays,
      and strategies for implementation at individual sites. Four conference calls
      designed to enhance implementation were held one, two, three, and five months
      after training. RESULTS: Ten 1.5-day workshops were held in conjunction with
      annual meetings of COG, APOSW, APHON, and SPP. A total of 209 psychosocial
      clinicians from 134 sites were trained. Evaluations were highly favorable.
      Trainees had provided BI to 545 individuals as of the last conference call.
      CONCLUSIONS: Initial dissemination goals were met. BI is now available at
      numerous pediatric oncology centers, but it has not become part of routine care. 
      Future work focused on implementation might consider top-down approaches that
      include direct communication with pediatric oncologists and hospital leaders
      about the benefits of incorporating this evidence-based intervention
      systemically.

TI  - Psychosocial Barriers and Their Impact on Hepatocellular Carcinoma Care in US
      Veterans: Tumor Board Model of Care.
PG  - S32-S36
LID - 10.12788/fp.0272 [doi]
AB  - Background: Psychosocial barriers, including low socioeconomic status,
      homelessness, alcohol and substance use disorders, and psychiatric disorders are 
      prevalent in US veterans. Our study aims to identify the prevalence of
      psychosocial barriers in veterans diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 
      and their impact on receipt of cancer care. Methods: A retrospective cohort study
      was performed of all veterans diagnosed with HCC at the William S. Middleton
      Memorial Veterans' Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin, whose tumor care was
      coordinated through a multidisciplinary tumor board. Outcomes included receipt of
      any HCC-specific therapy and overall survival. Results: From January 1, 2007,
      through December 31, 2016, 149 veterans were diagnosed with HCC. Substance use
      disorders were reported in 124 (83%) patients, psychiatric illness was documented
      in 55 (37%) patients, 23 (15%) patients had incomes below the poverty threshold, 
      and 7 (5%) were experiencing homelessness. The mean (SD) distance traveled for
      care was 207.1 (277.9) km; travel and lodging assistance were accessed by 50
      (34%) and 33 (22%) veterans, respectively. Seventy-one patients (48%) had HCC
      exceeding T2 stage at diagnosis. Curative treatment was offered to 78 (52%)
      patients, with 127 (85%) receiving any HCC-specific care. Median survival from
      diagnosis was 727 days (95% CI, 488-966). Conclusions: Psychosocial barriers were
      common in our veteran cohort. Individualizing care, and coordination of travel
      and lodging, assisted in enabling high rates of receipt of HCC-specific therapy
      and improving patient survival.

      Black Veteran Population.
PG  - S48-S51
LID - 10.12788/fp.0269 [doi]
AB  - Background: Black individuals and veterans are at higher risk for developing lung
      cancer compared with that of the general population. Evidence suggests the
      screening criteria have been too conservative for this population. Methods: This 
      study is a retrospective chart review examining the applicability of the 2013
      United States Preventive Services Task Force lung cancer screening guidelines in 
      a US Department of Veteran Affairs institution that served a a predominantly
      black population. Patients diagnosed with stage 1 or 2 lung cancer from 2005
      through 2017 were included and grouped by whether or not they met United States
      Preventive Services Task Force screening criteria. Results: There was a
      significantly higher proportion of Black patients in the study group that did not
      meet screening criteria (68% vs 54%, P = .04), highlighting the concern that this
      population was being underscreened with the 2013 guidelines. Conclusions: An
      individualized, risk-based screening model could be more effective at diagnosing 
      early-stage lung cancer and requires more investigation.

PG  - S8-S11
LID - 10.12788/fp.0262 [doi]
AB  - Background: Studies have shown that nonmedical reading is associated with low
      burnout and that small group study sections can promote wellness. Burnout and
      other psychosocial distress are common among health care professionals,
      necessitating additional measures to promote well-being. The field of narrative
      medicine is one proposed solution. Observations: We added small narrative
      medicine group discussions of nonmedical fiction to our hematology oncology
      clinical program to promote physician resilience and decrease risk for burnout.
      We explored how reading and reflecting would result in profound changes in
      thinking and feeling and noted 7 different ways by which reading and reflecting
      together can increase well-being. We describe how stories led us to increase
      bonding, improve empathy, and promote meaning in medicine. Conclusions: Our small
      group discussions showed that the intervention was feasible, improved empathy and
      fulfillment at work, and resulted in greater appreciation for the human
      dimensions of health care.

      With Polycythemia Vera.
PG  - S43-S46
LID - 10.12788/fp.0243 [doi]
AB  - Background: Patients with polycythemia vera (PV), a chronic myeloproliferative
      neoplasm, have a greater morbidity and mortality risk than the general
      population, largely due to a high incidence of thrombotic events. Observations:
      Two recently published retrospective analyses from Parasuraman and colleagues
      used Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data to replicate, in a real-world
      population, findings from the prospective, randomized Cytoreductive Therapy in
      Polycythemia Vera (CYTO-PV) study. In the CYTO-PV study, hematocrit (Hct) level
      and white blood cell (WBC) count were shown to be independently associated with
      thrombotic event risk in patients with PV. In the VHA analysis, patients with Hct
      levels < 45% were found to have a significantly lower rate of thrombotic events
      compared to those with levels >/= 45% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.61; P = .04). For WBC
      counts and thrombosis, patients with WBC >/= 8.5 x 10(9)/L were found to have a
      higher rate of thrombotic events compared to the reference cohort of WBC < 7 x
      10(9)/L (HR, 1.47; P < .01), and the rates were higher for those with WBC >/= 11 
      x 10(9)/L (HR 1.87; P < .001). Conclusions: The results from these analyses
      suggest the need for managing Hct appropriately to maintain levels < 45% and
      offer further support for the consideration of WBC counts in determining risk of 
      thrombotic events. Studies are needed to clearly establish an optimal WBC count
      to inform updates to treatment guidelines.

PG  - 2243-2252
LID - 10.2147/CMAR.S364875 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To explore the risk factors of anastomotic leakage (AL) after
      laparoscopic anterior resection (AR) of rectal cancer and establish a nomogram
      prediction model. Methods: Clinical and surgical data of patients who underwent
      AR of rectal cancer at Sichuan Cancer Hospital from January 2017 to December 2020
      were retrospectively collected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression
      analyses were used to screen the independent risk factors of AL after AR. A
      nomogram risk prediction model was established based on the selected independent 
      risk factors and the predictive performance of nomogram was evaluated. Results: A
      1013 patients undergoing laparoscopic AR were included, of which 67 had AL, with 
      an incidence of 6.6%. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses
      showed that male gender, tumors distance from the anus verge of </= 5cm, tumors
      distance from the anus verge of 5-10cm, circumferential tumor growth, operation
      time >/= 240min, and no diverting stoma were independent risk factors for AL
      after AR. A nomogram prediction model was established based on these results. The
      calibration curve showed that the predicted occurrence probability of the
      nomogram model was in good agreement with the actual occurrence probability. The 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.749.
      Conclusion: The nomogram prediction model based on the independent risk factors
      of patients undergoing AL after AR can effectively predict the probability of AL.

TI  - Lymphocyte Depletion Rate as a Biomarker of Radiation Dose to Circulating
      Lymphocytes During Fractionated Partial-Body Radiation Therapy.
PG  - 100959
LID - 10.1016/j.adro.2022.100959 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Radiation causes exponential depletion of circulating lymphocyte
      populations; in turn, radiation-induced lymphopenia is associated with worse
      survival for many solid tumors, possibly owing to attenuated antitumor immune
      responses. Identifying reliable and reproducible methods of calculating the
      radiation dose to circulating immune cells may facilitate development of
      techniques to reduce the risk and severity of radiation-induced toxic effects to 
      circulating lymphocytes. Methods and Materials: Patient-specific lymphocyte loss 
      rates were derived from a clinical data set including 684 adult patients with
      solid tumors. Multivariable linear regression was used to model the relationship 
      between the lymphocyte loss rate and physical parameters of the radiation plan
      that determine circulating blood dose. Results: During partial-body radiation,
      lymphocyte loss rates are determined by physical parameters of the radiation plan
      that reflect radiation exposure to circulating cells, including target volume
      size, dose per fraction squared, and anatomic site treated. Differences in
      observed versus predicted lymphocyte loss rates may be partly explained by
      variations in concurrent chemotherapy regimens. Conclusions: We describe a novel 
      method of using patient-specific lymphocyte loss kinetics to approximate the
      effective radiation dose to circulating lymphocytes during focal fractionated
      photon radiation therapy. Clinical applications of these findings include the
      early identification of patients at particularly high risk of severe
      radiation-induced lymphopenia based on physical parameters of the radiation
      therapy plan.

TI  - The vaginal microbiome is associated with endometrial cancer grade and histology.
PG  - 447-455
LID - 10.1158/2767-9764.CRC-22-0075 [doi]
AB  - The human microbiome has been strongly correlated with disease pathology and
      outcomes, yet remains relatively underexplored in patients with malignant
      endometrial disease. In this study, vaginal microbiome samples were prospectively
      collected at the time of hysterectomy from 61 racially and ethnically diverse
      patients from three disease conditions: 1) benign gynecologic disease (controls, 
      n=11), 2) low-grade endometrial carcinoma (n=30), and 3) high-grade endometrial
      carcinoma (n=20). Extracted DNA underwent shotgun metagenomics sequencing, and
      microbial alpha and beta diversities were calculated. Hierarchical clustering was
      used to describe community state types (CST), which were then compared by
      microbial diversity and grade. Differential abundance was calculated, and machine
      learning utilized to assess the predictive value of bacterial abundance to
      distinguish grade and histology. Both alpha- and beta-diversity were associated
      with patient tumor grade. Four vaginal CST were identified that associated with
      grade of disease. Different histologies also demonstrated variation in CST within
      tumor grades. Using supervised clustering algorithms, critical microbiome markers
      at the species level were used to build models that predicted benign vs
      carcinoma, high-grade carcinoma versus benign, and high-grade versus low-grade
      carcinoma with high accuracy. These results confirm that the vaginal microbiome
      segregates not just benign disease from endometrial cancer, but is predictive of 
      histology and grade. Further characterization of these findings in large,
      prospective studies is needed to elucidate their potential clinical applications.

TI  - Abdominal Computed Tomography Enhanced Image Features under an Automatic
      Segmentation Algorithm in Identification of Gastric Cancer and Gastric Lymphoma.
PG  - 2259373
LID - 10.1155/2022/2259373 [doi]
AB  - To analyze the application value of CT-enhanced scanning based on artificial
      intelligence algorithm in the diagnosis of gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma,
      the CT images of 80 patients with Borrmann type IV gastric cancer or primary
      gastric lymphoma diagnosed by endoscopic pathology were retrospectively
      collected. Meanwhile, a lymph node recognition algorithm based on OTSU threshold 
      segmentation was proposed for CT image processing. The results showed that the
      missed diagnosis rate of suspected lymph nodes and the missed lymph node
      detection rate of this algorithm were substantially lower than those of other
      algorithms (P < 0.05). The probability of gastric wall motility disappearance,
      perigastric fat infiltration, and type A enhancement pattern in the Borrmann type
      IV gastric cancer group was higher than that in the gastric lymphoma group, with 
      remarkable differences (P < 0.05). There was no remarkable difference between the
      Borrmann type IV gastric cancer group and the gastric lymphoma group in the
      probability of swollen lymph nodes under the renal hilum (P > 0.05). In addition,
      5the sensitivity (83.17%), specificity (95.52%), and accuracy (93.08%) of the
      combined detection of the three CT signs (stomach wall motility, perigastric fat 
      infiltration, and enhancement mode) were substantially improved compared with
      those of a single sign (P < 0.05). To sum up, the lymph node recognition
      algorithm based on OTSU threshold segmentation had better performance in
      detecting gastric lymph nodes than traditional algorithms. The CT image
      characteristics of gastric wall motility, perigastric fat infiltration, and
      enhancement pattern based on artificial intelligence algorithms were effective
      indicators for distinguishing gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma.

TI  - Effects of mir-195 Targeted Regulation of JAK2 on Proliferation, Invasion, and
      Apoptosis of Gastric Cancer Cells.
PG  - 5873479
LID - 10.1155/2022/5873479 [doi]
AB  - Background: Overexpression of miR-195 can make gastric cancer cells stay in G1/G2
      phase. miR-195 has been shown to inhibit gastric cancer cell replication and
      accelerate cell death by targeting JAK2. However, the relationship between
      miR-195, JAK2, and gastric cancer is not clear. Objective: To observe the effect 
      of mir-195 regulated by JAK2 on the growth, invasion, and death of gastric cancer
      cells. Methods: MGC803 and NCI gastric N87 cells were introduced into the
      negative control sequences of miR-195 and RNA, respectively. To detect the
      expression of miR-195 in cells, to detect the effect of miR-195 on mitosis and
      proliferation of tumor cells, to analyze the effect of miR-195 on cell invasion
      and metastasis, and to detect the regulation of miR-195 on JAK2 expression.
      Results: The level of miR-195 in miR-195-MIMICS group was significantly higher
      than that in miR-NC group. The cell survival rate of miR-195 mimic group was
      lower than that of miR-NC group (P < 0.05). Compared with miR-NC group, the
      number of cells in G1 phase increased, the cells in G2 phase and S phase
      decreased, and the proportion of cells in G2 and S phase decreased in miR-195
      mimic group. The scratch distance of miR-195 simulator group was larger than that
      of control group. The number of invasive cells in the miR-195 mimic group was
      significantly lower than that in the control group. The expression of JAK2
      protein in miR-195 mimic group was lower than that in miR-NC group. There was a
      significant negative correlation between the expression level of miR-195 and JAK2
      (rhabdomile 0.326 and record 0.00). There are continuous interaction fragments
      between JAK2 and miR-195. The luciferase activity of miR-195 mimic and wild type 
      JAK2 sequence expression vector was significantly lower than that of wild type
      JAK2 sequence expression vector. Conclusion: miR-195 may inhibit the occurrence, 
      metastasis, and invasion of gastric tumor by downregulating the expression of
      JAK2. miR-195/JAK2 may be a new molecular target for the treatment of
      gastrointestinal tumors.

AB  - In recent years, the evolution of the molecular biological technical background
      led to the widespread application of single-cell sequencing, a versatile tool
      particularly useful in the investigation of tumor heterogeneity. Even 10 years
      ago the comprehensive characterization of colorectal cancers by The Cancer Genome
      Atlas was based on measurements of bulk samples. Nowadays, with single-cell
      approaches, tumor heterogeneity, the tumor microenvironment, and the interplay
      between tumor cells and their surroundings can be described in unprecedented
      detail. In this review article we aimed to emphasize the importance of
      single-cell analyses by presenting tumor heterogeneity and the limitations of
      conventional investigational approaches, followed by an overview of the whole
      single-cell analytic workflow from sample isolation to amplification, sequencing 
      and bioinformatic analysis and a review of recent literature regarding the
      single-cell analysis of colorectal cancers.

      prognosis, related molecular changes and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).
      In addition, 198 GAC cases were collected to further study the relationship
      between the loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression and clinicopathology, prognosis,
      microsatellite stability, PD-L1 expression and TIL in GAC. DNA whole-exome
      sequencing was performed on 7 cases of gastric cancer with loss of PBRM1
      expression. Results: The cBioPortal data showed that PBRM1 deletion/mutation
      accounted for 7.32% of GAC and was significantly associated with several
      molecular changes, such as molecular subtypes of GAC. The LinkedOmics dataset
      showed that PBRM1 mutation and its promoter DNA methylation showed lower PBRM1
      mRNA expression, and PBRM1 mutation cases showed significantly higher mRNA
      expression of PD-L1 (CD274). TISIDB data showed that PBRM1 abnormalities were
      significantly positively associated with multiple TILs. In our group of 198
      cases, the loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression was significantly positively
      correlated with intra-tumoral tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (iTILs) and
      deficient MMR and PD-L1 expression. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that
      the overall survival of GAC patients with loss/attenuation of PBRM1 expression
      was significantly better (p = 0.023). iTIL was an independent prognostic factor
      of GAC. Loss of PBRM1 expression often co-occurs with mutations in other SWI/SNF 
      complex subunit genes, and there are some repetitive KEGG signaling changes.
      Conclusion: Abnormality of the PBRM1 gene may be related to the occurrence of
      some GACs and can affect tumor immune activity, thereby affecting
      clinicopathology and prognosis. It may be a potentially effective predictive
      marker for immunotherapy and a novel therapeutic approach associated with
      synthetic lethality.

AB  - Developing drug delivery nanosystems with both anticancer and antibacterial
      effects is of great clinical value. Herein, we report a facile approach to
      synthesize Ag and quaternary ammonium salt (QAS) co-decorated mesoporous silica
      nanoparticles (MSNs), namely, Ag/QAS-MSNs, for synergistic treatment of cancer
      and bacterial infections. In vitro studies demonstrated that Ag/QAS-MSNs not only
      had a strong antibacterial activity against the bacterial pathogens but also
      could efficiently induce cancer cell death through an apoptotic pathway.
      Moreover, in vivo combination therapy with Ag and QAS in Ag/QAS-MSNs was also
      tested in a nude mouse tumor model, and a significant synergistic anticancer
      effect, which is superior to that obtained by therapy with Ag-MSNs or QAS-MSNs
      alone, was achieved. Such excellent anticancer and antibacterial activity of
      Ag/QAS-MSNs could be attributed to the synergistic effect of Ag ions and QAS.
      Thus, Ag/QAS-MSNs have a promising future as potent anticancer agents with high
      antibacterial performance.

TI  - TMUB1 Correlated with Immune Infiltration Is a Prognostic Marker for Colorectal
      Cancer.
PG  - 5884531
LID - 10.1155/2022/5884531 [doi]
AB  - Background: Transmembrane and ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 1 (TMUB1) 
      is overexpressed in a large number of liver and esophageal tumors. However, only 
      a few reports on the clinical significance of TMUB1 in colorectal cancer (CRC)
      exist. Methods: Here, we evaluated the clinical significance and potential
      biological role of TMUB1 using bioinformatics analysis. Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship of TMUB1 with
      clinicopathological features. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed
      to identify the biological function of TMUB1, while any associations between the 
      expression of TMUB1 and the infiltration of 24 immune cells were analyzed using
      simple-sample GSEA. Results: TMUB1 was significantly overexpressed in CRC tissues
      compared with normal controls. The high expression of TMUB1 in CRC was associated
      with T stage, neotype, and residual tumor. Moreover, TMUB1 was identified as an
      independent factor of poor disease-free survival (DFS) and short overall survival
      (OS). GSEA demonstrated that TMUB1 was related to hypoxia, angiogenesis,
      adipogenesis, inflammatory response, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, apoptosis, mitotic 
      spindle, and IL2-STAT5 signaling. The expression of TMUB1 negatively correlated
      with the abundance of T helper cells, Tcm cells, macrophages, and Th2 cells,
      whereas it positively correlated with the abundance of several immune cell types,
      including CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells. Conclusions: The high expression of
      TMUB1 is closely related to a poor prognosis in patients with CRC. TMUB1 may be a
      potential prognostic biomarker and be used for therapeutic approaches in CRC.

TI  - Chemotherapy Utilization in Men with Advanced Penile Cancer.
PG  - 12-15
LID - 10.1097/UPJ.0000000000000270 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Although studies using mixed insurance populations suggest that
      chemotherapy use in men with advanced penile cancer (PC) is low, it is unclear
      what regimens are being utilized. In this study, we use a database of insured
      patients to better understand specific chemotherapy utilization in men with PC.
      Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with stage IIIB or IV
      PC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database
      (2004-2015). Standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy was defined by the National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network(R) guidelines: 4 cycles of paclitaxel, ifosfamide
      and cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil with cisplatin in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or
      primary setting. We calculated what proportion of patients receive SOC or any
      chemotherapy within 2 years of diagnosis and analyzed what factors were
      associated with receiving chemotherapy. Results: Our study included 147
      patients-48 stage IIIB and 99 stage IV. Of these patients, 49 (33%) received
      chemotherapy. Less than 5% of men received SOC. About 10% received SOC
      chemotherapy but an insufficient number of cycles. Married men were more likely
      to undergo chemotherapy (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-7.8). Less than 5% of the 24 Black or
      Hispanic patients received chemotherapy compared to 37% of white patients (p
      <0.001). Conclusions: Only a third of men with stage IIIB/IV PC underwent
      chemotherapy. Less than 5% of men received complete guideline-based regimens.
      Whether this is driven primarily by patient or provider factors is unknown,
      although social determinants of health may play a role. These data highlight the 
      difficulty for patients with PC to get chemotherapy.

AB  - Esophageal cancer (ESCA) is a malignant tumor of the upper gastrointestinal
      tract, with a high mortality rate and poor prognosis. Long noncoding RNAs
      (lncRNAs) play a role in the malignant progression of tumors by regulating
      autophagy. This study is aimed at establishing a prognostic model of
      autophagy-related lncRNAs in ESCA and provide a theoretical basis to determine
      potential therapeutic targets for ESCA. The transcriptome expression profiles
      were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified
      autophagy-related mRNAs and lncRNAs in ESCA using differential expression
      analysis and the Human Autophagy Database (HADb). Four differentially expressed
      autophagy-related lncRNAs with a prognostic value were identified using Cox
      regression and survival analyses. Furthermore, the combination of the selected
      lncRNAs was able to predict the prognosis of patients with ESCA more accurately
      than any of the four lncRNAs individually. Finally, we constructed a coexpression
      network of autophagy-related mRNAs and lncRNAs. This study showed that
      autophagy-related lncRNAs play an important role in the occurrence and
      development of ESCA and could become a new target for the diagnosis and treatment
      of this disease.

AB  - A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers that may be received
      anywhere in the world; the five-year survival rate is very less. The majority of 
      cases of this condition may be traced back to pancreatic cancer. Due to medical
      image scans, a significant number of cancer patients are able to identify
      abnormalities at an earlier stage. The expensive cost of the necessary gear and
      infrastructure makes it difficult to disseminate the technology, putting it out
      of the reach of a lot of people. This article presents detection of pancreatic
      cancer in CT scan images using machine PSO SVM and image processing. The Gaussian
      elimination filter is utilized during the image preprocessing stage of the
      removal of noise from images. The K means algorithm uses a partitioning technique
      to separate the image into its component parts. The process of identifying
      objects in an image and determining the regions of interest is aided by image
      segmentation. The PCA method is used to extract important information from
      digital photographs. PSO SVM, naive Bayes, and AdaBoost are the algorithms that
      are used to perform the classification. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of
      the PSO SVM algorithm are better.

AB  - Background: The role of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in
      metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) patients remains unclear. The present study aimed
      to evaluate the effect of HER2 status on MBC patients by propensity-score
      matching (PSM). Methods: The SEER data from 2010 to 2016 were extracted. The
      breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) of MBC patients, diagnosed from 2001 to
      2016, was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The multivariate Cox proportional
      model between groups was performed. PSM was used to make 1:1 case-control
      matching. Results: We included 1887 patients with a median follow-up time of 28
      months (range 1-83 months). 1749 (92.7%) and 138 (7.3%) patients presented in the
      HER2-negative group and HER2-positive group. 833 (44.1%) patients received
      post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT). The HER2-positive group had younger
      patients, lower tumor grades, and more advanced tumor stages. The prognoses were 
      related to age of diagnosis, race/ethnicity, TNM stage, and PMRT in multivariate 
      Cox analysis. ER status and HER2 status had no impact on BCSS. In the
      Kaplan-Meier analysis, PMRT was associated with a better prognosis. Importantly, 
      patients with HER2-negative status can benefit from PMRT, but not those with
      HER2-positive status. After PSM, on multivariate Cox analysis, the prognosis was 
      related to HER2 status and PMRT. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis, PMRT was related
      to a better prognosis for HER2-negative patients. Conclusions: Our findings
      supported that PMRT and HER2-positive status were associated with a better
      prognosis after PSM. However, HER2-negative, but not HER2-positive patients could
      benefit from PMRT.

AB  - Glioma is a common intracranial malignancy in adults and has a high mortality due
      to its poor prognosis and high recurrence rate. Dysregulation of protein
      degradation is one of the main promoting factors in glioma development. As an
      indispensable unit of the proteasome, Proteasome 20S Subunit Beta 9 (PSMB9) is
      one of the major enzymes in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation in cells. In 
      addition, proteasomes also participate in a series of cellular processing, like
      immune regulation, nerve signal transduction, material transport through
      channels, cell adhesion, and various signaling pathways. However, the
      relationship between the PSMB9 expression and the occurrence of lower-grade
      glioma (LGG) is still unknown. First, we collected the RNA-seq and clinical
      information about LGG clinical samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
      cohort, Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA; including CGGAseq1 and CGGAseq2)
      cohort, and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; GSE16011, GSE61374, and Rembrandt)
      cohort. Then, these data were used for differential analysis, survival analysis, 
      enrichment analysis, clinical model construction, etc. In addition, we combine
      immune-related data for immune-related analysis, including immune infiltration
      and immunotherapy. Through the above research, we have provided a new biomarker
      for LGG prognosis prediction and more comprehensively explained the role of PSMB9
      in the development of LGG. This study determined that PSMB9 can be used as an
      immunotherapy target through the analysis of immune data, providing new ideas for
      the clinical treatment of LGG.

AB  - D-dimer level is often used to assess the severity of trauma as well as the risk 
      of thrombosis. This study investigated the risk factors for high postoperative
      D-dimer level. This study included a total of 2706 patients undergoing breast
      cancer surgery to examine the associations between various clinicopathological
      factors and variation in D-dimer levels. After adjusting for other factors, T
      stage, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, blood loss, surgery type, diabetes, and elevated
      leukocyte and neutrophil counts were found to be significant risk factors for
      D-dimer variation. This study identified several factors associated with elevated
      D-dimer levels and consequent thrombosis after breast cancer surgery, which may
      aid in the development of more precise preventive measures and interventions as
      well as serve as a reference for future research.

      Promoting the Ubiquitin/Proteasome Degradation of HIF-1alpha.
PG  - 899385
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.899385 [doi]
AB  - Transmembrane protein 100 (TMEM100) is involved in embryonic cardiovascular
      system development. However, the biological role of TMEM100 in human cancers,
      particularly colorectal cancer (CRC), is unclear. In this study, tissue
      microarrays were stained using immunohistochemistry methods to evaluate the
      association between TMEM100 levels and clinic-pathological features for CRC.
      Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests revealed that decreased levels of TMEM100
      correlated with shorter overall survival. Cox regression revealed that reduced
      levels of TMEM100 was an independent prognostic factor for detrimental survival
      in CRC. A lentiviral vector was used to overexpress TMEM100 in HCT116 cells, and 
      small interfering RNA was used to knockdown TMEM100 in SW480 cells. The CCK-8
      assay, colony formation analysis, cell cycle analysis, cell migration assay,
      mouse xenograft model and mouse lung metastasis model showed that TMEM100
      suppressed CRC cell proliferation and migration in vitro and in vivo. IHC scores 
      of TMEM100 and HIF-1alpha were significantly negatively correlated. A half-time
      determination analysis in which cells were treated with cycloheximide revealed
      that TMEM100 shortened the HIF-1alpha half-life. Further immunoprecipitation
      experimental results showed that TMEM100 promoted the ubiquitination of
      HIF-1alpha, which caused HIF-1alpha degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway.
      Angiogenesis assay and migration assay results revealed that TMEM100 suppressed
      the migration and angiogenesis induction capacities of HCT116 cells, but this
      inhibitory effect was abolished when HIF-1alpha degradation was blocked by MG132 
      treatment. These results indicated that TMEM100 inhibited the migration and the
      angiogenesis induction capacities of CRC cells by enhancing HIF-1alpha
      degradation via ubiquitination/proteasome pathway.

      Therapy.
PG  - 861210

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the factors for local-regional 
      recurrence (LRR) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT). We established a
      practical nomogram to predict the likelihood of LRR after BCT based on
      hematological parameters and clinicopathological features. Methods: A
      retrospective analysis was performed on 2,085 consecutive breast cancer patients 
      who received BCT in Shandong Cancer Hospital from 2006 to 2016, including 1,460
      patients in the training cohort and 625 patients in the validation cohort.
      Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed based on hematological
      parameters (fibrinogen, platelets, mean platelet volume, neutrophils, monocytes, 
      and lymphocytes) and clinicopathological characteristics to identify the
      independent factors for LRR. Subsequently, a nomogram for predicting LRR was
      established by logistic regression analysis. The nomogram was validated in 625
      patients in the validation cohort. Results: During the median follow-up period of
      66 months, 44 (3.01%) patients in the training cohort and 19 (3.04%) patients in 
      the validation cohort suffered from LRR. Multivariate analysis showed six
      independent factors related to LRR, including molecular subtype, pathological N
      stage, re-resection, radiotherapy or not, platelet count*MPV*fibrinogen (PMF),
      and neutrophil count/lymphocyte count ratio (NLR). Six variables were entered
      into logistic regression to establish the nomogram for predicting LRR. The
      nomogram of LRR showed excellent discrimination and prediction accuracy. The area
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.89 (p < 0.001, 95% 
      CI = 0.83, 0.95) in the training cohort and 0.88 (p < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.8, 0.96) 
      in the validation cohort. Calibration curves for the prediction model in the
      training and validation cohorts both demonstrated satisfactory consistency
      between the nomogram-predicted and actual LRR. Conclusion: The combination of
      hematological parameters and clinicopathological characteristics can predict LRR 
      after BCT. The predictive nomogram based on preoperative and postoperative
      indicators of BCT might serve as a practical tool for individualized
      prognostication. More prospective studies should be performed to verify the
      model.

TI  - A Cross-Comparison of High-Throughput Platforms for Circulating MicroRNA
      Quantification, Agreement in Risk Classification, and Biomarker Discovery in
      Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.

LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.911613 [doi]
AB  - Background: Circulating microRNAs (ct-miRs) are promising cancer biomarkers. This
      study focuses on platform comparison to assess performance variability, agreement
      in the assignment of a miR signature classifier (MSC), and concordance for the
      identification of cancer-associated miRs in plasma samples from non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: A plasma cohort of 10 NSCLC patients and
      10 healthy donors matched for clinical features and MSC risk level was profiled
      for miR expression using two sequencing-based and three quantitative reverse
      transcription PCR (qPCR)-based platforms. Intra- and inter-platform variations
      were examined by correlation and concordance analysis. The MSC risk levels were
      compared with those estimated using a reference method. Differentially expressed 
      ct-miRs were identified among NSCLC patients and donors, and the diagnostic value
      of those dysregulated in patients was assessed by receiver operating
      characteristic curve analysis. The downregulation of miR-150-5p was verified by
      qPCR. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung carcinoma dataset was used for
      validation at the tissue level. Results: The intra-platform reproducibility was
      consistent, whereas the highest values of inter-platform correlations were among 
      qPCR-based platforms. MSC classification concordance was >80% for four platforms.
      The dysregulation and discriminatory power of miR-150-5p and miR-210-3p were
      documented. Both were significantly dysregulated also on TCGA tissue-originated
      profiles from lung cell carcinoma in comparison with normal samples. Conclusion: 
      Overall, our studies provide a large performance analysis between five different 
      platforms for miR quantification, indicate the solidity of MSC classifier, and
      identify two noninvasive biomarkers for NSCLC.

      Prognostic Factor in Bladder Cancer Patients After Radical Cystectomy.
PG  - 895413
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.895413 [doi]
AB  - Background: The effect of lymph node resection on the prognosis of bladder cancer
      (BLCA) patients receiving radical cystectomy should not be ignored. Our aim was
      to explore the prognostic value of the log odds of negative lymph nodes/T stage
      (LONT) and construct a more effective nomogram based on LONT to predict
      cancer-specific survival (CSS) in postoperative BLCA patients. Methods: Patients 
      diagnosed with BLCA after radical cystectomy between 2004 and 2015 in the
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were enrolled. We
      randomly split (7:3) these patients into the primary cohort and internal
      validation cohort. 86 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang
      University were collected as the external validation set. Univariate and
      multivariate cox regression analyses were carried out to seek prognostic factors 
      of postoperative BLCA patients. According to these significantly prognostic
      factors, a simple-to-use nomogram was established for predicting CSS. Their
      performances were evaluated by using calibration curves, the concordance index
      (C-index), the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve
      analysis (DCA). In addition, different risk groups were tested by Kaplan-Meier
      curves and log-rank tests. Result: Whether in cancer-specific survival (CSS) or
      overall survival (OS), LONT was an independent and significant prognostic factor.
      Through further screening, the ultimate nomogram of CSS was composed of nine
      independent prognostic factors including LONT, age, race, tumor size, histologic 
      type, T stage, N stage, summary stage and chemotherapy. The C-index of nomogram
      in the primary cohort, internal and external validation cohort were 0.734, 0.720 
      and 0.728, respectively. The AUC of predicting CSS at 3 and 5 years were 0.783
      and 0.774 in the primary cohort and 0.781 and 0.781 in the validation cohort. The
      results of calibration and DCA showed good concordance and clinical
      applicability. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were displayed in CSS among
      different risk groups. Conclusion: LONT was regarded as a novel and reliable
      prognostic factor. Compared with the AJCC staging system, the established
      nomogram based on LONT can more effectively predict the prognosis of BLCA
      patients after radical cystectomy.

AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and inflammation have been reported in
      penile carcinomas (PeCa). However, the cell types and cellular crosstalk involved
      in PeCa are unexplored. We aimed to characterize the complexity of cells and
      pathways involved in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in PeCa and propose target 
      molecules associated with the TME. We first investigated the prognostic impact of
      cell types with a secretory profile to identify drug targets that modulate
      TME-enriched cells. The secretome analysis using the PeCa transcriptome revealed 
      the enrichment of inflammation and extracellular matrix pathways. Twenty-three
      secreted factors were upregulated, mainly collagens and matrix metalloproteinases
      (MMPs). The deregulation of collagens and MMPs was confirmed by Quantitative
      reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Further, the
      deconvolution method (digital cytometry) of the bulk samples revealed a high
      proportion of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells. Increased DCs
      and B cells were associated with better survival. A high proportion of
      cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was observed in low-survival patients.
      Patients with increased CAFs had decreased immune cell proportions. The treatment
      with the MMP inhibitor GM6001 in CAF cells derived from PeCa resulted in altered 
      cell viability. We reported a crosstalk between immune cells and CAFs, and the
      proportion of these cell populations was associated with prognosis. We
      demonstrate that a drug targeting MMPs modulates CAFs, expanding the therapeutic 
      options of PeCa.

AB  - Radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is a recent concern in patients with lung 
      cancer after being treated with radiotherapy. Most of information we have in the 
      field of cardiac toxicity comes from studies utilizing real-world data (RWD) as
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally not practical in this field.
      This article is a narrative review of the literature using RWD to study RIHD in
      patients with lung cancer following radiotherapy, summarizing heart dosimetric
      factors associated with outcome, strength, and limitations of the RWD studies,
      and how RWD can be used to assess a change to cardiac dose constraints.

TI  - Interactions of Colorectal Cancer, Dietary Fats, and Polymorphisms of
      Arachidonate Lipoxygenase and Cyclooxygenase Genes: A Literature Review.
PG  - 865208
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.865208 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Genetics and dietary factors play important roles in the development
      of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the underlying mechanisms of the
      interactions between CRC, gene polymorphisms, and dietary fat are unclear. This
      review study investigated the effects of polymorphisms of arachidonate
      lipoxygenase (ALOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) genes in the association between CRC
      and dietary fat. Methods: All the related papers published from 2000 to 2022 were
      collected from different databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and
      Cochran using related keywords such as colorectal cancer, ALOX, COX,
      polymorphism, and dietary fat. Non-English and unrelated documents were excluded.
      Results: Some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ALOX and COX genes,
      such as rs2228065, rs6413416, and rs4986832 in the ALOX gene, and rs689465 in the
      COX gene may play significant roles in the association between the risk of CRC
      and dietary fats. SNPs of ALOX and COX genes may influence the effects of dietary
      fatty acids on the risk of CRC. Conclusion: Some polymorphisms of the ALOX and
      COX genes may have important roles in the effects of dietary fat on the risk of
      CRC. If future studies confirm these results, dietary recommendations for
      preventing colorectal cancer may be personalized based on the genotype of the
      ALOX and COX genes.

TI  - Cell-Free DNA Sequencing of Intraocular Fluid as Liquid Biopsy in the Diagnosis
      of Vitreoretinal Lymphoma.
PG  - 932674
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.932674 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To seek novel diagnostic approaches, we improved the workflow of
      cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sequencing and evaluated its feasibility in vitreoretinal
      lymphoma (VRL) specimens; the profile of mutations was preliminarily analyzed for
      potential diagnostic value. Methods: The study was a diagnostic trial. 23 eyes of
      23 patients with VRL and 25 eyes of 25 patients with inflammatory eye diseases
      were enrolled. Approximate 500mul undiluted vitreous humor and 10ml diluted
      vitreous fluid was obtained through diagnostic vitrectomy and sent for
      cytopathological examinations. 500mul of the diluted vitreous fluid was spared
      for cfDNA sequencing. For cfDNA sequencing, DNA fragmentation procedure was added
      to the workflow to improve the extraction efficiency; mutations detected were
      analyzed for potential diagnostic model. The sensitivity and specificity of the
      cytopathology and cfDNA sequencing were compared. The clinical manifestations
      were preliminarily analyzed for potential correlations with the genotypes.
      Results: CfDNA sequencing was accomplished in 23 eyes with VRL and 20 eyes with
      inflammatory eye diseases. VRL-related mutated genes included MYD88 (18 eyes,
      78%), ETV6 (11 eyes, 48%), PIM1 (11 eyes,48%), BTG2 (7 eyes, 30%), IRF4 (7 eyes, 
      30%), CD79B (6 eyes, 26%), LRP1B (6 eyes, 26%), etc. Logistic regression based on
      the mutations of MYD88 and ETV6 was of the potential for the diagnosis of VRL
      (P<0.001, adjusted R2 = 0.789, sensitivity 0.913, specificity 0.950); by
      comparison, the sensitivity and specificity of the vitreous cytopathology were
      0.826 and 1.000, respectively. Further analysis of the mutation profile showed
      that patients carrying CD79B mutation tended to have higher intraocular
      interleukin-10 level (P=0.030), that CARD11 mutation was correlated with younger 
      age at ocular onset (P=0.039), and that patients with intracranial involvement
      carried more multiple-site mutations in the BTG2 gene (P=0.013). Conclusions: The
      improved workflow of CfDNA sequencing is of sound feasibility in a limited amount
      of vitreous humor. The logistic model based on the mutations could help to
      provide reliable clues for the diagnosis of VRL.

TI  - A Phase II Study Evaluating the Interest to Combine UCPVax, a Telomerase CD4
      TH1-Inducer Cancer Vaccine, and Atezolizumab for the Treatment of HPV Positive
      Cancers: VolATIL Study.
PG  - 957580
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.957580 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is a strong rational of using anti-programmed cell death
      protein-1 and its ligand (anti-PD-1/L1) antibodies in human papillomavirus
      (HPV)-induced cancers. However, anti-PD-1/L1 as monotherapy induces a limited
      number of objective responses. The development of novel combinations in order to 
      improve the clinical efficacy of an anti-PD-1/L1 is therefore of interest.
      Combining anti-PD-1/L1 therapy with an antitumor vaccine seems promising in
      HPV-positive (+) cancers. UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine composed of two 
      separate peptides derived from telomerase (hTERT, human telomerase reverse
      transcriptase). UCPVax is being evaluated in a multicenter phase I/II study in
      NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) and has demonstrated to be safe and
      immunogenic. The aim of the VolATIL study is to evaluate the combination of
      atezolizumab (an anti-PD-L1) and UCPVax vaccine in a multicenter phase II study
      in patients with HPV(+) cancers. Methods: Patients with HPV(+) cancer (anal
      canal, head and neck, and cervical or vulvar), at locally advanced or metastatic 
      stage, and refractory to at least one line of systemic chemotherapy are eligible.
      The primary end point is the objective response rate (ORR) at 4 months. Patients 
      will receive atezolizumab every 3 weeks at a fixed dose of 1,200 mg in
      combination with the UCPVax vaccine at 1 mg subcutaneously. Discussion:
      Anti-cancer vaccines can restore cancer-immunity via the expansion and activation
      of tumor-specific T cells in patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. 
      Moreover, preclinical data showed that specific TH1 CD4 T cells sustain the
      quality and homing of an antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell immunity. In previous
      clinical studies, the induction of anti-hTERT immunity was significantly
      correlated to survival in patients with advanced squamous anal cell carcinoma.
      Thus, there is a strong rational to combine an anti-cancer hTERT vaccine and an
      immune checkpoint inhibitor to activate and promote antitumor T-cell immunity.
      This pivotal proof of concept study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the 
      combination of a telomerase-based TH1 inducing vaccine (UCPVax) and an anti-PD-L1
      (atezolizumab) immunotherapy in HPV(+) cancers, as well as confirming their
      synergic mechanism, and settling the basis for a new combination for future
      clinical trials. Clinical Trial Registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/,

      tumorigenesis and progression.
PG  - 963617
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.963617 [doi]
AB  - Accumulated evidence has revealed that F-box protein, a subunit of SCF E3
      ubiquitin ligase complexes, participates in carcinogenesis and tumor progression 
      via targeting its substrates for ubiquitination and degradation. F-box proteins
      could be regulated by cellular signaling pathways and noncoding RNAs in
      tumorigenesis. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), one type of noncoding RNAs, has been 
      identified to modulate the expression of F-box proteins and contribute to
      oncogenesis. In this review, we summarize the role and mechanisms of multiple
      lncRNAs in regulating F-box proteins in tumorigenesis, including lncRNAs

      linc01436, linc00494, GATA6-AS1, and ODIR1. Moreover, we discuss that targeting
      these lncRNAs could be helpful for treating cancer via modulating F-box protein
      expression. We hope our review can stimulate the research on exploration of
      molecular insight into how F-box proteins are governed in carcinogenesis.
      Therefore, modulation of lncRNAs is a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer
      therapy via regulation of F-box proteins.

AB  - Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (PNEN) are tumors that originate from
      neuroendocrine cells. Only about 1% patients are related to mutation of tuberous 
      sclerosis complex gene. Here, we reported a rare case with involvement of
      multiple organs and space-occupying lesions. Initially, the patient was thought
      to have metastasis of a pancreatic tumor. However, the patient was diagnosed as
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, liver perivascular epithelioid tumors, splenic 
      hamartoma, and renal angiomyolipoma by pathological examination after surgery. We
      performed genetic mutation detection to identify that tuberous sclerosis complex 
      2 gene presented with a heterozygous variant. Tuberous sclerosis often presents
      with widespread tumors, but it is less common to present with pancreatic
      neuroendocrine tumors and liver perivascular tumors as highlighted in the case.
      So we analyzed the relationship between TSC gene mutations and related tumors.
      And we also reviewed the current molecular mechanisms and treatments for tuberous
      sclerosis complex.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of
      image-guided high-dose rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for the
      reirradiation of cervical cancer within a previously irradiated area. Methods and
      materials: Twenty-three consecutive patients with cervical cancer were
      reirradiated with curative intent using brachytherapy (BT) with or without
      external beam irradiation. The median biologically equivalent dose in 2-Gy
      fractions (EQD2) for reirradiation was 64.0 Gy (range: 31.3-95.1 Gy), and the
      median cumulative EQD2 (for primary treatment and reirradiation) was 152.4 Gy
      (range: 97.8-200.9 Gy). The average clinical target volume was 82.9 cm(3) (range:
      26.9-208.3 cm(3)), and the median treatment-free interval (TFI) was 13 months
      (range: 3-93 months). Results: The median follow-up time was 19 months (range:
      2-59 months). The complete response rate after reirradiation was 56.5%. The 1-,
      2- 3-, and 4-year post-relapse survival (PRS) rates were 65.2%, 43.5%, 33.8%, and
      27.1%, respectively. The median reirradiation EQD2 D2cc of rectum and bladder was
      39.5 Gy (range = 14.6-96.2 Gy) and 52.1 Gy (range = 29.1-114.2 Gy). The median
      cumulative EQD2 D2cc of rectum and bladder was 115.0 Gy (range = 84.4-189.3 Gy)
      and 130.5 Gy (range = 95.5-173.5 Gy). During follow-up, nine (39.1%) patients had
      experienced grade 3 or 4 late toxicities. Grade >/=3 rectal toxicity occurred in 
      three patients (13.0%). Grade >/=3 urinary toxicity occurred in five patients
      (21.7%). One patient (4.3%) had both grade >/=3 urinary and rectal toxicity.
      Tumor volume, TFI, tumor invasion organ number, and local control were
      significant prognostic factors adversely affecting OS. Conclusions: For recurrent
      cervical cancer after radiotherapy, reirradiation of HDR-ISBT is feasible, even
      if the local tumor invasion is large, with a good chance of survival and
      acceptable side effects.

AB  - Traditionally, lymph node metastases (LNM) evaluation is essential to the staging
      of colon cancer patients according to the TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) system.
      However, in recent years evidence has accumulated regarding the role of emerging 
      pathological features, which could significantly impact the prognosis of
      colorectal cancer patients. Lymph Node Ratio (LNR) and Log Odds of Positive Lymph
      Nodes (LODDS) have been shown to predict patients' prognosis more accurately than
      traditional nodal staging and it has been suggested that their implementation in 
      existing classification could help stratify further patients with overlapping TNM
      stage. Tumor deposits (TD) are currently factored within the N1c category of the 
      TNM classification in the absence of lymph node metastases. However, studies have
      shown that presence of TDs can affect patients' survival regardless of LNM.
      Moreover, evidence suggest that presence of TDs should not be evaluated as
      dichotomic but rather as a quantitative variable. Extranodal extension (ENE) has 
      been shown to correlate with presence of other adverse prognostic features and to
      impact survival of colorectal cancer patients. In this review we will describe
      current staging systems and prognostic/predictive factors in colorectal cancer
      and elaborate on available evidence supporting the implementation of LNR/LODDS,
      TDs and ENE evaluation in existing classification to improve prognosis estimation
      and patient selection for adjuvant treatment.

AB  - Despite the advancement in research methodologies and technologies for cancer
      research, there is a high rate of anti-cancer drug attrition. In this review, we 
      discuss different conventional and modern approaches in cancer research and how
      human-centric models can improve on the voids conferred by more traditional
      animal-centric models, thereby offering a more reliable platform for drug
      discovery. Advanced three-dimensional cell culture methodologies, along with in
      silico computational analysis form the core of human-centric cancer research.
      This can provide a holistic understanding of the research problems and help
      design specific and accurate experiments that could lead to the development of
      better cancer therapeutics. Here, we propose a new human-centric research roadmap
      that promises to provide a better platform for cancer research and drug
      discovery.

TI  - Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Killing Mechanisms of Antitumor Cytotoxic
      CD4(+) TCR-T Cells.
PG  - 939940

AB  - T cell receptor-engineered T cells (TCR-Ts) have emerged as potent cancer
      immunotherapies. While most research focused on classical cytotoxic CD8(+) T
      cells, the application of CD4(+) T cells in adoptive T cell therapy has gained
      much interest recently. However, the cytotoxic mechanisms of CD4(+) TCR-Ts have
      not been fully revealed. In this study, we obtained an MHC class I-restricted
      MART-127-35-specific TCR sequence based on the single-cell V(D)J sequencing
      technology, and constructed MART-127-35-specific CD4(+) TCR-Ts and CD8(+) TCR-Ts.
      The antitumor effects of CD4(+) TCR-Ts were comparable to those of CD8(+) TCR-Ts 
      in vitro and in vivo. To delineate the killing mechanisms of cytotoxic CD4(+)
      TCR-Ts, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and found that classical
      granule-dependent and independent cytolytic pathways were commonly used in CD4(+)
      and CD8(+) TCR-Ts, while high expression of LTA and various costimulatory
      receptors were unique features for cytotoxic CD4(+) TCR-Ts. Further signaling
      pathway analysis revealed that transcription factors Runx3 and Blimp1/Tbx21 were 
      crucial for the development and killing function of cytotoxic CD4(+) T cells.
      Taken together, we report the antitumor effects and multifaceted killing
      mechanisms of CD4(+) TCR-Ts, and also indicate that MHC class I-restricted CD4(+)
      TCR-Ts could serve as potential adoptive T cell therapies.

TI  - Pyroptotic Patterns in Blood Leukocytes Predict Disease Severity and Outcome in
      COVID-19 Patients.
PG  - 888661
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.888661 [doi]
AB  - The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has lasted for over 2
      years now and has already caused millions of deaths. In COVID-19, leukocyte
      pyroptosis has been previously associated with both beneficial and detrimental
      effects, so its role in the development of this disease remains controversial.
      Using transcriptomic data (GSE157103) of blood leukocytes from 126 acute
      respiratory distress syndrome patients (ARDS) with or without COVID-19, we found 
      that COVID-19 patients present with enhanced leukocyte pyroptosis. Based on
      unsupervised clustering, we divided 100 COVID-19 patients into two clusters
      (PYRcluster1 and PYRcluster2) according to the expression of 35
      pyroptosis-related genes. The results revealed distinct pyroptotic patterns
      associated with different leukocytes in these PYRclusters. PYRcluster1 patients
      were in a hyperinflammatory state and had a worse prognosis than PYRcluster2
      patients. The hyperinflammation of PYRcluster1 was validated by the results of
      gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of proteomic data (MSV000085703). These
      differences in pyroptosis between the two PYRclusters were confirmed by the
      PYRscore. To improve the clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients, we used least
      absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct a
      prognostic model based on differentially expressed genes between PYRclusters
      (PYRsafescore), which can be applied as an effective prognosis tool. Lastly, we
      explored the upstream transcription factors of different pyroptotic patterns,
      thereby identifying 112 compounds with potential therapeutic value in public
      databases.

PG  - 919489
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.919489 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dysregulated interleukin (IL)-6 production can be characterised by
      the levels present, the kinetics of its rise and its inappropriate location.
      Rapid, excessive IL-6 production can exacerbate tissue damage in vital organs. In
      this situation, therapy with an anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)
      monoclonal antibody, if inappropriately dosed, may be insufficient to fully block
      IL-6 signalling and normalise the immune response. Methods: We analysed
      inhibition of C-reactive protein (CRP) - a biomarker for IL-6 activity - in
      patients with COVID-19 or idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD)
      treated with tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) or siltuximab (anti-IL-6), respectively. We
      used mathematical modelling to analyse how to optimise anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6R
      blockade for the high levels of IL-6 observed in these diseases. Results: IL-6
      signalling was insufficiently inhibited in patients with COVID-19 or iMCD treated
      with standard doses of anti-IL-6 therapy. Patients whose disease worsened
      throughout therapy had only partial inhibition of CRP production. Our model
      demonstrated that, in a scenario representative of iMCD with persistent high IL-6
      production not controlled by a single dose of anti-IL-6 therapy, repeated
      administration more effectively inhibited IL-6 activity. In a situation with
      rapid, high, dysregulated IL-6 production, such as severe COVID-19 or a cytokine 
      storm, repeated daily administration of an anti-IL-6/anti-IL-6R agent, or
      alternating daily doses of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-6R therapies, could neutralise
      IL-6 activity. Conclusion: In clinical practice, IL-6 inhibition should be
      individualised based on pathophysiology to achieve full blockade of CRP
      production. Funding: EUSA Pharma funded medical writing assistance and provided
      access to the phase II clinical data of siltuximab for analysis.

AB  - Glioma is the most common primary brain tumor in the human brain. The present
      study was designed to explore the expression of PIMREG in glioma and its
      relevance to the clinicopathological features and prognosis of glioma patients.
      The correlations of PIMREG with the infiltrating levels of immune cells and its
      relevance to the response to immunotherapy were also investigated. PIMREG
      expression in glioma was analyzed based on the GEO, TCGA, and HPA databases.
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to examine the predictive value of PIMREG
      for the prognosis of patients with glioma. The correlation between the
      infiltrating levels of immune cells in glioma and PIMREG was analyzed using the
      CIBERSORT algorithm and TIMRE database. The correlation between PIMREG and immune
      checkpoints and its correlation with the patients' responses to immunotherapy
      were analyzed using R software and the GEPIA dataset. Cell experiments were
      conducted to verify the action of PIMREG in glioma cell migration and invasion.
      We found that PIMREG expression was upregulated in gliomas and positively
      associated with WHO grade. High PIMREG expression was correlated with poor
      prognosis of LGG, prognosis of all WHO grade gliomas, and prognosis of recurrent 
      gliomas. PIMREG was related to the infiltration of several immune cell types,
      such as M1 and M2 macrophages, monocytes and CD8+ T cells. Moreover, PIMREG was
      correlated with immune checkpoints in glioma and correlated with patients'
      responses to immunotherapy. KEGG pathway enrichment and GO functional analysis
      illustrated that PIMREG was related to multiple tumor- and immune-related
      pathways. In conclusion, PIMREG overexpression in gliomas is associated with poor
      prognosis of patients with glioma and is related to immune cell infiltrates and
      the responses to immunotherapy.

AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a malignant tumor with a high morbidity and
      mortality rate that is a threat to human health. With the development of
      molecular targeted research, breakthroughs have been made on the molecular
      mechanism of lung cancer. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like
      4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (EML4-ALK) fusion gene is one of the most important 
      pathogenic driver genes of NSCLC discovered thus far. Four generations of
      targeted drugs for EML4-ALK have been developed, with patients benefiting
      significantly from these drugs. Therefore, EML4-ALK has become a research hotspot
      in NSCLC. The aim of the present study is to introduce the current research
      progress of EML4-ALK and its association with NSCLC.

TI  - miR-29b-3p inhibits 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell proliferation through the
      YWHAE/BCL-2 regulatory axis.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignant tumours in the world
      and seriously affects health of men. Studies have shown that microRNA
      (miR)-29b-3p and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation
      protein epsilon (YWHAE) play important roles in influencing the proliferation and
      apoptosis of PCa cells. However, the molecular mechanism of miR-29b-3p and YWHAE 
      in the proliferation and apoptosis of PCa cells remains unclear. In the present
      study, bioinformatics as well as in vivo and in vitro experiments were used to
      predict and verify the targeting relationship between YWHAE and mir-29B-3p and
      investigate the potential roles of YWHAE and mir-29b-3p in the proliferation and 
      apoptosis of 22RV1 cells. Using bioinformatics and a double luciferase system
      assay, it was confirmed that miR-29b-3p can target YWHAE 3'untranslated region
      and affect the expression of YWHAE, suggesting that miR-29b-3p may be a potential
      miRNA of YWHAE. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, Cell Counting Kit-8,
      Transwell and cell scratch assays showed that miR-29b-3p significantly inhibited 
      the proliferation, invasion and migration of 22Rv1 cells (P<0.01). Rescue
      experiments demonstrated that YWHAE gene introduction reversed the inhibitory
      effect of miR-29b-3p on 22Rv1 cells. Western blotting revealed that the
      upregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited YWHAE expression, resulting in a very
      significant decrease in the ratio of p-BAD/BAD and full-length caspase 3/cleaved 
      caspase 3 (P<0.01) and an extremely significant increase in the ratio of
      BAX/BCL-2 (P<0.01). A tumourigenesis test in nude mice in vivo confirmed that the
      upregulation of miR-29b-3p inhibited tumour growth by targeting YWHAE. The
      present experiments confirmed that miR-29b-3p plays a tumour suppressor role in
      22Rv1 PCa cells, and the YWHAE/BCL-2 regulatory axis plays a vital role in
      miR-29b-3p regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of 22Rv1 cells. These
      results may provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and targeted treatment 
      of PCa.

TI  - HS-1793 inhibits cell proliferation in lung cancer by interfering with the
      interaction between p53 and MDM2.
PG  - 290
LID - 10.3892/ol.2022.13410 [doi]
AB  - The transcription factor or tumor suppressor protein p53 regulates numerous
      cellular functions, including cell proliferation, invasion, migration, senescence
      and apoptosis, in various types of cancer. HS-1793 is an analog of resveratrol,
      which exhibits anti-cancer effects on various types of cancer, including breast, 
      prostate, colon and renal cancer, and multiple myeloma. However, to the best of
      our knowledge, the role of HS-1793 in lung cancer remains to be examined. The
      present study aimed to investigate the anti-cancer effect of HS-1793 on lung
      cancer and to determine its association with p53. The results revealed that
      HS-1793 reduced cell proliferation in lung cancer and increased p53 stability,
      thereby elevating the expression levels of the target genes p21 and mouse double 
      minute 2 homolog (MDM2). When the levels of MDM2, a negative regulator of p53,
      are increased under normal conditions, MDM2 binds and degrades p53; however,
      HS-1793 inhibited this binding, confirming that p53 protein stability was
      increased. In conclusion, the findings of the present study provide new evidence 
      that HS-1793 may inhibit lung cancer proliferation by disrupting the p53-MDM2
      interaction.

TI  - Unique cessation tools in the box: Quitline utilization and effectiveness trends 
      among a large sample of tobacco users reporting mental health disorders.
PG  - 869802
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.869802 [doi]
AB  - It is estimated that the prevalence of smoking among adults with MHDs ranges
      between 40-60%, as compared to about 17% among those without an MHD. In addition,
      smokers with MHDs smoke more cigarettes, are more nicotine dependent, and
      experience more difficulty quitting, compared to other smokers. The uniquely high
      smoking prevalence among the MHD population is a serious public health concern;
      unfortunately, a majority of individuals experiencing difficulty receive no
      treatment. The US Public Health Service guidelines, as well as the National
      Cancer Institute, strongly recommend quitlines as an evidence-based treatment
      strategy to reduce barriers to cessation treatment, especially among smokers with
      MHDs; however, the literature is sparse on quitline engagement trends and
      associated outcomes for quitline participants with MHDs. This study sought to
      contribute to this gap with the largest sample to-date of MHD-endorsing tobacco
      quitline (Oklahoma Tobacco Helpline, OTH) participants. From 2015 to 2020,
      ~65,000 registrants (45-50% of total registered participants) with the OTH
      identified as having one or more MHDs in addition to their tobacco use. This
      study tested for the presence of significant differences between groups with and 
      without MHDs (as well as within the MHD-identified group) on program enrollment
      selections, the intensity of engagement with chosen services, NRT utilization,
      and quit rates. It also tested for the existence of differences and moderating
      effects of demographic variables associated with the comparison groups.
      Statistically significant differences were found between these two groups with
      regard to: sex, age, racial identity, education level, annual income and
      insurance status. Significant differences were also found with tobacco use
      patterns reported by individuals (e.g., timing and daily use amounts).
      Differences in quitline program selection were demonstrated, such that the
      MHD-endorsing sample were more likely to participate and agree to the most robust
      service available. Significantly higher rates of service intensity (number of
      services engaged) were demonstrated, and MHD individuals were also significantly 
      more likely to receive NRT as a part of their treatment. This study suggests a
      simplistic "more is better" quitline services approach may suffer in
      effectiveness because it neglects barriers common to this population. Important
      information is provided on these unique variables associated with MHD-endorsing
      individuals trying to quit their tobacco use. These results can help tobacco
      quitlines conceptualize the unique difficulties experienced by individuals with
      MHDs and then tailor their approach to respond supportively and constructively to
      this high need group.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of chimeric antigen receptor T cells in digestive system 
      cancers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 508
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-5019 [doi]
AB  - Background: As a successful treatment for hematological malignancy, chimeric
      antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) have been expanded to solid tumors to
      demonstrate their safety and efficacy, especially for digestive system cancer
      (DSC). Various CAR-T cell constructs used in different types of DSCs result in
      heterogeneous responses. Thus, we aimed to systematically summarize the clinical 
      response of DSCs treated with CAR-T cells and investigate factors associated with
      heterogeneity in outcomes. Methods: Clinical studies of DSC patients treated with
      CAR-T cell therapy were selected from the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of
      Science databases before October 1, 2020. "CAR-T cell", "solid tumor" and their
      synonymous terms were used to construct the search strategy. Duplicates, reviews,
      non-English literature, articles not related to clinical studies or CAR-T cells
      used for digestive tumors were excluded. The included studies were assessed by
      the Institute of Health Economics (IHE) risk of bias tool to check the
      methodological quality. The inverse variance method was used to perform data
      pooling and subgroup analysis to clarify the causes of heterogeneity. Publication
      bias was examined by funnel plots and Egger's test. Results: Twelve studies were 
      included, and the risk of bias evaluation was demonstrated as plots using Review 
      Manager 5.3. The pooled overall response rate (ORR) was 2% (95% CI: 0-6%), and
      the clinical benefit rate (CBR) was 42% (95% CI: 24-61%). According to subgroup
      analysis, costimulation (P=0.0449), lymphodepletion (P=0.0002), persistence of
      CAR-T cells (P=0.0443) and transduction method (P=0.0165) were factors
      contributing to heterogeneity. For adverse effects, pyrexia was the most frequent
      (35%, 95% CI: 24-61%). No publication bias was found, and the major results were 
      robust within a slight fluctuation for each removal of one of the 12 studies.
      Discussion: CAR-T cell therapy is generally beneficial for patients with DSCs
      though the ORR was still poor. Modified construction with more specific tumor
      antigens, costimulatory domain and lentiviral vectors is necessary to obtain a
      better antitumor response of CAR-T cell therapy. Information of survival data are
      needed for a more comprehensive analysis.

TI  - Development and validation of an eight-gene signature based predictive model to
      evaluate the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma patients: a bioinformatic
      study.
PG  - 524
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1934 [doi]
AB  - Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with a poor
      prognosis, however, biomarkers for the prognostic assessment of HCC remain
      suboptimal. Consequently, we aimed to develop a reliable tool for prognostic
      estimation of HCC. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and
      adjacent normal tissues in 3 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets were
      identified, followed by hub gene selection and least absolute shrinkage and
      selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression to develop a prognostic gene signature.
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, univariate and multivariate Cox regression,
      time-dependent area under the curve (AUC), and integrated value of time-dependent
      AUC (iAUC) were used to assess the relationship between predictors and clinical
      outcomes in the training and validation datasets. Then we built nomograms
      including gene signature and clinicopathological factors to forecast the
      probability of death. Moreover, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to
      compare the expression of prognostic genes between HCC and adjacent normal
      tissues. Finally, the relationship between prognostic genes and tumor
      microenvironment (TME) was investigated using immune cell infiltration algorithms
      and single cell transcriptomic database. Results: Eight prognostic genes (CDC20, 
      PTTG1, TOP2A, CXCL2, CXCL14, CYP2C9, MT1F, and GHR) were finally identified to
      construct the gene signature. Each patient's risk score was calculated according 
      to the gene signature. Patients with high-risk scores showed worse outcomes in
      the training set [hazard ratio (HR) =3.404, P<0.001]. Risk score, age, body mass 
      index (BMI), and TNM stage were identified as independent prognostic factors for 
      overall survival (OS) in the training set. The nomogram including risk score and 
      other independent prognostic factors showed better performance as opposed to the 
      clinicopathological model. In the validation dataset, we obtained the similar
      results as well. Moreover, we found a close relationship between risk score and
      immune cell infiltration. Patients with high-risk scores had elevated expression 
      of immune checkpoint genes, indicating that these patients may be more suitable
      for immunotherapy. Conclusions: We have established and validated an eight-gene
      based prognostic model, which could be an effective tool for the prognostic
      evaluation of HCC patients.

TI  - Complications and oncological outcomes after salvage surgery for recurrent and
      residual hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma: a retrospective cohort study.
PG  - 525
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1844 [doi]
AB  - Background: Salvage surgery for hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC)
      after radiotherapy may result in several postoperative complications and the
      oncological outcome is unsatisfying. Therefore, identifying the risk factors for 
      postoperative complications and oncological outcome after salvage surgery is
      important. This study aimed to determine which HPSCC patients might benefit from 
      salvage surgery following previous radiotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively
      analyzed 91 HPSCC patients who underwent salvage surgery due to locoregional
      recurrence/residual disease after radiotherapy. The pre- and intraoperative
      characteristics with complications and oncological outcomes were collected
      through medical records and telephone follow-up. Risk factors for complications
      were analyzed by binary logistic regression. The oncological outcomes were
      assessed by overall survival (OS) after salvage surgery. Kaplan-Meier curves and 
      Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used for univariate and
      multivariate survival analyses. Results: Postoperative complications occurred in 
      40.7% of patients, with pharyngo-cutaneous fistula (PCF) occurring in 29.7% of
      patients. Salvage surgery for local disease was the only independent risk factor 
      for postoperative complications and PCF [complications: odds ratio (OR) =5.298,
      95% confidence interval (CI): 1.163-24.130, P=0.031; PCF: OR =4.543, 95% CI:
      1.187-17.387, P=0.027). In the subgroup of patients with local disease, time of
      curative treatment initiation >90 days (OR =7.331, 95% CI: 1.278-42.054, P=0.025)
      and preoperative hemoglobin <118 g/L (OR =10.101, 95% CI: 1.026-99.492, P=0.045) 
      were independent risk factors for postoperative complications, while free flap
      reconstruction was an independent protective factor for PCF (OR =0.099, 95% CI:
      0.010-0.934, P=0.043). The median OS time was 17 months, with 5-year OS rates of 
      30%. Age at salvage surgery <50 years [hazard ratio (HR) =2.047, 95% CI:
      1.217-3.443, P=0.007] and recurrence or retreatment clinical T stage 3-4 (rcT3-4)
      (HR =2.051, 95% CI: 1.219-3.450, P=0.007) were identified as risk factors for OS.
      The 5-year OS rates of patients without and with both risk factors were 43% and
      10% (P=0.001). Conclusions: Salvage surgery for locoregional recurrence/residual 
      disease after previous radiotherapy could improve survival in selected patients
      with HPSCC. Patients with local recurrence/residual disease had a higher
      complication rate. Efforts can be made to shorten the time of curative treatment 
      initiation and treat anemia to reduce the risk of postoperative complications in 
      this subgroup.

TI  - SLC2A1 plays a significant prognostic role in lung adenocarcinoma and is
      associated with tumor immunity based on bioinformatics analysis.
PG  - 519
LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1430 [doi]
AB  - Background: The treatment of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) has been stuck in a
      bottleneck due to a number of factors. There is a pressing need for research into
      potential genetic markers to help drug development and improve the prognosis of
      patients. SLC2A1 has been reported in multiple LUAD-related prognosis prediction 
      signatures. However, the role of SLC2A1 in the occurrence and development of LUAD
      and its impact on prognosis remain elusive. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas
      (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used to acquire the samples. We
      used R to perform statistical analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA),
      immune infiltration and immune cell correlation analysis, drug sensitivity
      analysis, and visualization. The immune cell score was calculated using the
      Timer2.0 database. Prognostic analysis was performed using R, Gene Expression
      Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and the Kaplan-Meier Plotter. Overall
      survival and progression free survival were the main outcome of prognosis
      analysis. Protein-protein interaction, disease-genetics analysis, and
      tissue-specific enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape. Results:
      SLC2A1 was highly expressed in LUAD tissues. Univariate COX regression [hazard
      ratio (HR) =1.689, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.242-2.249, P<0.001] and
      multivariate COX regression including age, gender, smoking, TNM stage and SLC2A1 
      expression (HR =1.567, 95% CI: 1.127-2.179, P=0.008) showed that SLC2A1 was an
      independent prognostic risk factor for LUAD. GSEA and Metascape analysis showed
      that SLC2A1 was strongly associated with the cell cycle, mitosis, lung tissue,
      and tumor recurrence. Immune correlation analysis showed that SLC2A1 was
      associated with two tumor infiltration immune cells: activated CD (cluster of
      differentiation)4(+) memory T cells (r=0.31, P=0.003) and activated mast cells
      (r=-0.28, P=0.010). Moreover, patients with high SLC2A1 expression had higher
      immune checkpoint molecules and Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE)
      scores, indicating poorer immunotherapy efficacy. Patients with high SLC2A1
      expression were more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs and less sensitive to
      targeted drugs compared to those with low SLC2A1 expression. Conclusions: The
      high expression of SLC2A1 in LUAD predicted poor prognosis and was closely
      related to tumor immunity, which could be used as an effective prognostic
      biomarker to provide a new strategy for clinical prognosis assessment and
      immunotherapy for LUAD.

TI  - Wedge resection before lobectomy for patients with T1N0M0 non-small cell lung
      cancer: a propensity score matching analysis.
PG  - 502
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-5246 [doi]
AB  - Background: Whether wedge resection of a tumor before lobectomy (Wed + Lob) can
      improve the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has yet to be
      determined comprehensively. This study aimed to compare the effects of Wed + Lob 
      with those of direct lobectomy (Lob) on survival and tumor cell dissemination in 
      patients with T1N0M0 NSCLC. Methods: A cohort of 813 patients with T1N0M0 NSCLC
      who underwent lobectomy at a single center in China was investigated. After
      propensity score matching, the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival
      (DFS) of patients were estimated using Kaplan-Meier plots. Associations between
      surgical strategies and patient survival were computed as hazard ratios and 95%
      confidence intervals using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Changes in
      folate receptor-positive circulating tumor cells (FR+ CTCs) after lobectomy were 
      analyzed in another cohort from our hospital. Results: A total of 401 Wed + Lob
      cases were matched with 255 Lob cases according to their propensity scores.
      Although no significant differences were found in OS, multivariate analysis
      showed that patients with T1N0M0 NSCLC in the Wed + Lob group had significantly
      improved DFS (HR =0.583; P=0.012) compared to those in the Lob group. After
      surgery, a decrease in FR+ CTCs was observed in 21 of 23 patients (91.3%) in the 
      Wed + Lob group and in 16 of 23 patients (69.6%) in the Lob group [mean changes: 
      6.10 (+/-7.80) FU per 3 mL vs. 1.31 (+/-4.39) FU per 3 mL; P=0.014]. Conclusions:
      Wed + Lob may improve DFS and reduce tumor cell dissemination in patients with
      T1N0M0 NSCLC.

TI  - A simple and practical intraoperative ventilation technique for uniportal
      video-assisted thoracoscopic tracheal reconstruction: a case report.
PG  - 529
LID - 10.21037/atm-21-6215 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cross-field endotracheal intubation is typically performed during
      tracheal anastomosis to maintain single-lung ventilation. To minimize obstruction
      of the surgical field by the cross-field tube, special equipment such as
      high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
      (ECMO) or advanced techniques such as non-intubated ventilation have been
      proposed. Here, we describe a simple and practical airway management strategy
      that requires only conventional ventilators and techniques. Our operation is
      completed under uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Case
      Description: We report a case of tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC)
      presenting with cough with bloody sputum in a 53-year-old man. Computed
      tomography (CT) and flexible bronchoscopy revealed an irregular polypoid neoplasm
      attached to the right wall of the distal trachea, which almost completely blocked
      the tracheal lumen. To relieve the symptoms, transbronchoscopic resection of the 
      tumor, followed by curative resection via uniportal VATS under general anesthesia
      was performed. To maintain single-lung ventilation during tracheal
      reconstruction, we took advantage of a thin suction tube [internal diameter (ID) 
      3 mm; external diameter (ED) 4 mm], which was connected to a conventional
      ventilator. Specifically, by introducing the suction tube into the distal left
      main bronchus through the endotracheal tube and blowing 100% oxygen, we achieved 
      satisfactory oxygenation throughout the anastomotic process; and the blood CO2
      partial pressure was also acceptable. The view of the anastomotic site was far
      less obstructed owing to the small diameter of the suction tube, and the
      anastomotic process was smooth and accurate. Postoperative recovery was good, and
      no stenosis of the reconstructed trachea was observed at the 3-month follow-up.
      Conclusions: Our technique proves to be safe and feasible for selected patients
      with tracheal tumors, and can be a practical choice for medical centers that are 
      not equipped with HFJV or ECMO.

LID - 10.21037/atm-22-1076 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major challenge
      for clinicians and scientists. Tumor organoid is a revelational disease model
      that highly resembled the heterogeneity and histopathological characteristics of 
      original tumors. This study aimed to optimize the modeling process of
      patient-derived NPC organoids (NPCOs), and establish a living-biobank of NPCs to 
      study the mechanism and explore the more effective treatment of the disease.
      Methods: Sixty-two fresh NPC tissue samples and 15 normal mucosa samples were
      collected for 3-dimensional (3D) organoid culture. The organoids were confirmed
      using hematoxylin and eosin assays. The expression levels of CD133, CD44, BMI-1, 
      and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) were detected by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Recurrent NPCOs were 
      frozen in liquid nitrogen for 6 months and then resuscitated and passaged.
      Results: We identified a novel two-step enzymatic strategy for the treatment of
      NPC and nasal mucosa specimens and an optimal medium for culturing NPCOs and
      nasal mucosa organoids (NMOs). Organoid cultures were generated from 34 primary
      NPC samples, 28 recurrent NPC samples, and 15 normal mucosa samples. The success 
      rates for primary NPCO, recurrent NPCO, and NMO formation were 47.06%, 81.25%,
      and 86.5%, respectively. All the NPCOs were EBER positive and CK7 negative.
      Recurrent NPCOs had higher expressions of stem cell markers, including BMI-1,
      CD44, and CD133. Additionally, recurrent NPCOs could be cultured to passage 4 and
      frozen and revived repeatedly, while primary NPCOs were challenging to culture.
      Conclusions: In summary, we successfully established a living biobank using the
      NPCO model, which has enormous potential in basic and clinical research on NPC.

TI  - Reproduction of the Antitumor Effect of Cisplatin and Cetuximab Using a
      Three-dimensional Spheroid Model in Oral Cancer.
PG  - 1320-1333
LID - 10.7150/ijms.74109 [doi]
AB  - Background/Aim: Cancer research has been conducted using cultured cells as part
      of drug discovery testing, but conventional two-dimensional culture methods are
      unable to reflect the complex tumor microenvironment. On the other hand,
      three-dimensional cultures have recently been attracting attention as in vitro
      models that more closely resemble the in vivo physiological environment. The
      purpose of this study was to establish a 3D culture method for oral cancer and to
      verify its practicality. Materials and Methods: Three-dimensional cultures were
      performed using several oral cancer cell lines. Western blotting was used for
      protein expression analysis of the collected cell masses (spheroids), and H-E
      staining was used for structural observation. The cultures were exposed to
      cisplatin and cetuximab and the morphological changes of spheroids over time and 
      the expression changes of target proteins were compared. Results: Each cell line 
      formed spheroidal cell aggregates and showed enhancement of cell adhesion
      molecules over time. H-E staining showed tumor tissue-like structures specific to
      each cell line. Cisplatin showed concentration-dependent antitumor effects due to
      loss of cell adhesion and spheroid disruption in each cell line, while cetuximab 
      exhibited antitumor effects that correlated with EGFR expression in each cell
      line. Conclusion: Spheroids made from oral cancer cell lines appeared to have
      tumor-like characteristics that may reflect their clinical significance. In the
      future, it may become possible to produce tumor spheroids from tissue samples of 
      oral cancer patients, and then apply them to drug screening and to develop
      individualized diagnostic and treatment methods.

TI  - Establishment and evaluation of retroperitoneal liposarcoma patient-derived
      xenograft models: an ideal model for preclinical study.
PG  - 1241-1253
LID - 10.7150/ijms.70706 [doi]
AB  - Retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RLPS) is one of the most common subtypes of
      retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas. It is characterized by poor sensitivity to 
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy and a low success rate of complete surgical
      resection. However, there are few reliable preclinical RLPS models for target
      discovery and therapy research. In this study, we aimed to establish RLPS
      patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models that are useful for biological research
      and preclinical drug trials. A total of 56 freshly resected RLPS tissues were
      subcutaneously transplanted into non-obese diabetic-severe combined immune
      deficient (NOD-SCID) mice, with subsequent xenotransplantation into
      second-generation mice. The tumor engraftment rate of first generation PDXs was
      44.64%, and higher success rates were obtained from implantations of
      dedifferentiated, myxous, pleomorphic, high-grade liposarcomas and those with
      retroperitoneal organ infiltration. The first- and second- generation PDX models 
      preserved the histopathological morphology, gene mutation profiles and MDM2
      amplification of the primary tissues. PDX models can also provide the benefit of 
      retaining original tumor biology and microenvironment characteristics, such as
      abnormal adipose differentiation, elevated Ki67 levels, high microvessel density,
      cancer-associated fibroblast presence, and tumor-associated macrophage
      infiltration. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients
      with successful first-generation PDX engraftment were significantly poorer than
      those with failed engraftment. Treatment with MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 significantly
      suppressed tumor growth of DDLPS PDX in mice. In conclusion, we successfully
      established RLPS PDX models that were histologically, genetically, and
      molecularly consistent with the original tissues. These models might provide
      opportunities for advancing RLPS tumor biology research, facilitating the
      development of novel drugs, particularly those targeting MDM2 amplification,
      adipose differentiation process, angiogenesis, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and
      so on.

AB  - Background: LncRNA MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript
      1) was competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) involved in various molecular processes
      for metastasis development in lung cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      in MALAT1 gene might be predictive markers for lung cancer. In our study, we
      selected rs619586 and rs3200401 in MALAT1 gene to explore their effects on lung
      cancer susceptibility. Methods: The case-control study included 444 lung cancer
      cases and 460 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed by Taqman allelic
      discrimination method. Logistic regression, Student t-test, and Chi-square test
      (chi(2) ) were used to analyze the data. Results: The findings of the study
      showed that rs3200401 was significantly associated with the risk of non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). Compared with
      homozygous CC genotype, CT heterozygous genotype decreased risk of NSCLC (P(a) = 
      0.034) and LUSC (P(a) = 0.025). In addition, no statistical association was
      detected between rs619586 and lung cancer susceptibility. The interactions
      between genes and cigarette smoking were discovered via crossover analysis.
      However, there were no remarkable gene-environment interactions in additive and
      multiplicative model. Conclusion: Rs3200401 in lncRNA MALAT1 was associated with 
      the susceptibility of non-small-cell lung cancer and lung squamous cell
      carcinoma. The gene-environmental (cigarette smoking) interactions were not
      notable.

AB  - Invasive lobular carcinoma is the second-most-common subtype of breast cancer. It
      is characterized by a different metastatic pattern with a propensity to
      metastasize to pleura, peritoneum, gastrointestinal tract, and ovary. We report a
      woman with known metastatic disease outside the gastrointestinal tract who had
      endoscopy and colonoscopy for gastrointestinal symptoms. Extensive metastases
      were found in the stomach and colon with a diffuse infiltration of signet
      ring-like cells at histology and immunohistochemical findings consistent with
      breast carcinoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such 
      a case from Africa.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of living-donor liver transplantation, hepatic resection, and 
      local therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma with three <3-cm nodules in a single
      institute.
PG  - 539-546
LID - 10.1002/jgh3.12783 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: Treatment for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
      determined based on the results of a liver function test and the tumor location
      and spread. The present study compared the outcomes among local therapy, hepatic 
      resection (HR), and living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for small HCC in a 
      single institute. Methods: We compared the overall survival, recurrence-free
      survival, and cancer-specific survival rates in patients with three HCC nodules
      <3 cm in size among local therapy, which included radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 
      percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE),
      and surgical treatment (HR and LDLT). Results: One hundred and ninety-seven
      patients with local therapy (109 RFA, 26 PEI, and 78 TACE), 107 with HR, and 66
      with LDLT were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference in OS 
      among these groups. The recurrence-free, cancer-specific survival (CSS) of LDLT
      was superior to local therapy and HR. The prognostic factors for the survival
      were Child-Pugh (CP) Grade B and tumor marker for local therapy and multiple
      tumors and elevated ALT levels for HR. Conclusions: For CP grade B patients with 
      HCC of three <3-cm nodule, LDLT could be considered because it resulted in better
      survival and CSS rates than local therapy.

TI  - Cumulative risk of developing a new symptom in patients with primary biliary
      cholangitis and its impact on prognosis.
PG  - 577-586
LID - 10.1002/jgh3.12789 [doi]
AB  - Background and Aim: Symptoms of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) frequently
      impair one's quality of life (QOL). Nonetheless, with improved treatment, the
      prognosis of PBC also improves. QOL plays an important role in patients with PBC.
      In this study, we aimed to reevaluate the transition of new symptom development
      in PBC and its predictive factors. Methods: This retrospective multicenter study 
      enrolled 382 patients with PBC for symptom analysis. The impact of a newly
      developed symptom on PBC prognosis was investigated by Kaplan-Meier analysis with
      propensity score matching and logistic progression analysis. Results: The
      cumulative risk of developing a new symptom after 10 and 20 years of follow-up
      was 7.6 and 28.2%, and specifically that of pruritus, which was the most common
      symptom, was 6.7 and 23.3%, respectively. In Cox hazard risk analysis, serum Alb 
      level (hazard ratio [HR], 1.097; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.165; P =
      0.002), the serum D-Bil level (HR, 6.262; 95% CI, 2.522-15.553, P < 0.001), and
      Paris II criteria (HR, 0.435; 95% CI, 0.183-1.036; P = 0.037) were significant
      independent predictors of a new symptom. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the
      overall survival and liver-related death were not significant between patients
      with and without a new symptom. Conclusion: The cumulative risk of new symptom
      development is roughly 30% 20 years after diagnosis and could be predicted by
      factors including serum albumin levels, serum D-Bil level, and Paris II criteria.

TI  - Potential ovarian toxicity and infertility risk following targeted anti-cancer
      therapies.
PG  - R147-R162
LID - 10.1530/RAF-22-0020 [doi]
AB  - Unlike traditional chemotherapy agents which are generally cytotoxic to all
      cells, targeted anti-cancer therapies are designed to specifically target
      proliferation mechanisms in cancer cells but spare normal cells, resulting in
      high potency and reduced toxicity. There has therefore been a rapid increase in
      their development and use in clinical settings, including in curative-intent
      treatment regimens. However, the targets of some of these drugs including
      kinases, epigenetic regulatory proteins, DNA damage repair enzymes and
      proteasomes, have fundamental roles in governing normal ovarian physiology.
      Inhibiting their action could have significant consequences for ovarian function,
      with potentially long-lasting adverse effects which persist after cessation of
      treatment, but there is limited evidence of their effects on reproductive
      function. In this review, we will use literature that examines these pathways to 
      infer the potential toxicity of targeted anti-cancer drugs on the ovary. Lay
      summary: Compared to traditional chemotherapy agents, anti-cancer therapies are
      thought to be highly effective at targeting cancer cells but sparing normal
      cells, resulting in reduced drug side effects. However, many of processes within 
      the cells that these drugs affect are also important for the ovary to work
      normally, so suppressing them in this way could have long-lasting implications
      for female fertility. This review examines the potential toxicity of anti-cancer 
      therapies on the ovary.

AB  - We report the clinico radiological presentation of an unusual case of an ossified
      soft tissue mass in the leg in a 74-year-old man. Calcific myonecrosis is a rare 
      soft tissue condition characterized by calcified mass within a compartment.
      Differential diagnosis of myonecrosis include myositis ossificans and sarcomas
      with propensity for extra-osseous calcification like extra-skeletal osteosarcoma,
      Ewing's sarcoma and epithelioid sarcoma. This entity is a late complication to
      trauma and prolonged high pressure state within the leg compartments. With
      imaging alone, the differential of soft tissue sarcoma could be ruled out but
      typical natural history of disease and radiopathological features aided in the
      diagnosis.

AB  - Tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCT) are benign intra-articular and soft-tissue 
      tumors. However, they are known for recurrence in incomplete excisions and tumors
      adjacent to the distal joints and neurovascular structures in hand. With poor
      knowledge of intrinsic biology behind these clonal neoplastic tumors, wide
      excision and three-dimensional conformal adjuvant radiotherapy to the tumor bed
      significantly prevent a recurrence. We report a recurrent TGCT of the thumb
      around the interphalangeal joint in a 54-year-old man treated with wide excision 
      and adjuvant three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT). There was no 
      recurrence, and the patient had excellent functional outcomes at 3 years of
      follow-up. Supplementary Information: The online version contains supplementary
      material available at 10.1007/s43465-022-00665-w.

TI  - Audit of principal investigator's compliance for submission of continue review
      application and decisions taken on lapses in validity of approval by the
      Institutional Ethics Committee at tertiary oncology center in Navi Mumbai.
PG  - 145-150
LID - 10.4103/picr.PICR_102_20 [doi]
AB  - Context: A failure to obtain continued Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC)
      approval for the study before the expiry date assigned by the IEC is considered
      as "lapse of the IEC approval" to continue the study at the site by the
      Investigator. Considering this, we had conducted an audit of principal
      investigators (PI ') compliance for Continuing Review Application (CRA)
      submission timelines and decision taken on the lapses in the validity of IEC
      approval continuation. Aim: The aim of this study is to assess the pre- and
      post-policy trends of non-compliance management of delayed CRA submission and
      compare the PI's compliance for submission of CRA between Investigator Initiated 
      trial (IIT) and Pharma studies. Setting and Design: The present study was a
      retrospective audit of CRAs of ongoing projects submitted by PIs to IEC, ACTREC. 
      Materials and Methods: The data from total 199 CRAs submitted for review to the
      IEC between the year January 2016 and December-2017 were collected and maintained
      in Microsoft Excel sheet, and later, the data were exported into the SPSS
      software version 21 for the analysis. Statistical Analysis: All categorical data 
      were presented in numbers and percentage. The first primary objective was
      assessed by calculating the duration between the dates of approval for any study 
      to the date of next CRA submission. The CRAs submitted after the project expiry
      date were considered as a lapse in following the IEC SOP. Results: This
      retrospective audit revealed that CRA reminder sent by the IEC to the PI played
      an important role in compliance w. r. t timely in following the IEC SOPof the CRA
      by the PI. As a result, overall, 90% of CRAs showed compliance in submitting CRAs
      to IEC in both IIT and Pharma study. The number of lapses were reduced to 7 in
      the postpolicy period as compared to 15 lapses in the prepolicy period.
      Conclusion: This retrospective audit reveals that CRA reminder sent by the IEC to
      the PI played an important role in improving the compliance of PIs in submitting 
      CRA to IEC. Each IEC should develop the policy to minimize the delays in CRA
      submission by the PI and prevent lapses in following the IEC SOP.

TI  - Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and CD68(+)CD163(+)M2-Like Macrophages as
      Therapeutic Response Biomarkers Are Associated with Plasma Inflammatory
      Cytokines: A Preliminary Study for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients in
      Radiotherapy.
PG  - 3621496
LID - 10.1155/2022/3621496 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recent studies show that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and
      M2-like macrophages are involved in the treatment of tumors; however, their
      therapeutic response role is rarely known in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      during radiotherapy. We aim to explore the dynamic alteration of the circulating 
      MDSCs and M2-like macrophages, to examine their relationship, and to evaluate
      their therapeutic response value for NSCLC patients in radiotherapy. Methods:
      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy controls and NSCLC patients with 
      different radiotherapy phases were isolated to examine the circulating MDSCs and 
      M2-like macrophages by flow cytometry. 40 plasma inflammatory cytokines were
      measured by multiplex ELISA. Results: In comparison with healthy controls, the
      percentages of MDSCs and CD68(+)CD163(+)M2-like macrophages of NSCLC patients
      were significantly elevated and were distinctly higher in radiotherapy than in
      preradiotherapy. MDSCs were correlated positively with CD68(+)CD163(+)M2-like
      macrophages in NSCLC patients in radiotherapy and postradiotherapy. Especially,
      we found that in comparison with those in the poor group, the percentages of two 
      cells in the good response group were markedly increased during radiotherapy and 
      they had a significantly positive correlation. During radiotherapy, the
      proportions of MDSCs were clearly increased in adenocarcinoma patients and the
      percentages of CD68(+)CD163(+)M2-like macrophages were markedly elevated in
      squamous carcinoma patients. We found that after radiotherapy, the expressions of
      eotaxin, MIP-1beta, MCP-1, and BLC were significantly increased in NSCLC
      patients. Further results showed that the low levels of eotaxin and TNF RII
      expression before radiotherapy could predict a good therapeutic response. IL-1ra 
      and MIP-1beta had a positive relation with MDSCs or CD68(+)CD163(+)M2-like
      macrophages in NSCLC patients during radiotherapy, and eotaxin was correlated
      with CD68(+)CD163(+)M2-like macrophages but not MDSCs in NSCLC patients after
      radiotherapy. Conclusions: MDSCs and CD68(+)CD163(+)M2-like macrophages serve as 
      therapeutic response biomarkers and are associated with the expressions of plasma
      inflammatory cytokines for NSCLC patients during radiotherapy.

TI  - Airway interventions for tracheobronchial involvement in esophageal carcinoma: a 
      retrospective cohort outcome study and algorithmic approach.
PG  - 2565-2578
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-138 [doi]
AB  - Background: In advanced esophageal carcinoma (EC), there is limited data on risk 
      factors predicting tracheobronchoesophageal fistula (TEF) formation and survival 
      among patients who required airway interventions. Methods: A retrospective
      analysis of consecutive patients with EC, who had airway involvement requiring
      intervention, was conducted from 1998 to 2018. Demographics, clinical progress,
      disease stage, treatment and survival outcomes were recorded. Patients were
      followed up till death or until completion of the study. Survival was estimated
      with the Kaplan-Meier method and curves compared by log-rank test. Multivariate
      analyses of risk factors were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression.
      Results: A total of 122 patients were included. The median (IQR) survival from
      time of airway intervention was 3.30 (1.57-6.88) months, while the median (IQR)
      survival from time of histological diagnosis was 8.90 (4.91-14.45) months. Tumour
      location within 20 mm of the carina, prior radiotherapy and/or esophageal
      stenting were significantly associated with formation of TEF. Mid EC [adjusted
      hazard ratio (HR) 1.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-3.2] or presence of TEF 
      (adjusted HR 1.8; 95% CI: 1.0-3.2) were associated with lower survival. Patients 
      receiving chemotherapy (adjusted HR 0.46; 95% CI: 0.25-0.84), or esophageal
      stenting whether before or after airway intervention (adjusted HR 0.32; 95% CI:
      0.15-0.68 and adjusted HR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29-0.90) were associated with increased
      survival. Conclusions: Factors associated with TEF formation include airway
      location, radiotherapy and prior esophageal stenting, and the development of TEF 
      was associated with poorer survival. An algorithmic approach towards
      tracheobronchial involvement in EC is proposed based on these findings and a
      review of the literature.

      cancers. However, its function in extensive-stage SCLC remains controversial.
      Considering that the maintenance of muscle mass may affect the survival of cancer
      patients. Herein, a retrospective study was conducted to investigate whether
      sarcopenia defined by skeletal muscle mass index at the third lumbar vertebra is 
      a prognostic factor in extensive-stage SCLC cancer patients. Methods: This
      retrospective analysis included extensive-stage SCLC patients diagnosed at the
      Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from January 2009 to March 2017 with
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Clinical data were collated for further examination,
      and CT or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT datasets were analyzed for body
      mass index (BMI) and L3MI. Follow-up data were collected by contacting patients
      or their families. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between the 
      date of treatment started and the date of death or censoring. The Kaplan-Meier
      product limit method and log-rank tests were used to assess differences in OS
      between the high L3MI and low L3MI groups. Cox regression analysis was used to
      identify independent factors of OS. Results: For the 139 extensive-stage SCLC
      patients, the median follow-up time was 26.1 months (range, 0.4 to 79.4 months). 
      The median OS was 9.5 months. There were no differences in age, inflammatory
      factors, nor progression after first-line treatment between the high L3MI and low
      L3MI groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the OS of the high L3MI group was 
      significantly longer than that of the low L3MI group (14.045 vs. 9.985 months;
      P=0.007), and multivariate analysis identified high L3MI to be an independent
      prognostic factor for predicting longer OS in extensive-stage SCLC patients
      [hazard ratio (HR), 0.623; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.405-0.960; P=0.032].
      Conclusions: Sarcopenia defined by L3MI is a prognostic factor for
      extensive-stage SCLC patients and early intervention of muscle mass maintaining
      may achieve better cancer management.

AB  - Background: EH domain contains protein 2 (EHD2) may be involved in tumorigenesis 
      and development. However, the role of EHD2 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is
      unknown. Methods: The link between EHD2 and LUAD and the associated underlying
      mechanism was determined using bioinformatics analysis. Then,
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to detect EHD2 expression level in LUAD
      patients. The stable transfection cell line was used to establish with lentivirus
      vector, and then the transfection efficiency was detected by western blot.
      Phagokinetic motility assays, transwell assays, and western blotting were also
      employed to investigate EHD2 impacts on cell viability. Results: The results
      indicated that EHD2 protein expression in human LUAD samples was significantly
      lower than that in the adjacent normal tissues. Low EHD2 expression was
      significantly linked to lymph node metastasis as well as advanced
      tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging (P<0.05). The Kaplan-Meier survival curve
      showed that low EHD2 expression was significantly associated with low survival
      (P=0.01). The multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that EHD2 expression
      and TNM stage were independent prognostic factors for LUAD patients (all P<0.05).
      The in vitro experiments demonstrated that EHD2 knockdown markedly contributed to
      an increase in migration and invasion in A549 cells. Overexpression of EHD2
      substantially suppressed H1299 cell migration and invasion. Furthermore,
      decreased E-cadherin expression was observed in A549 cells with EHD2 knockdown,
      as well as increased N-cadherin and vimentin expressions. By contrast, E-cadherin
      expression was increased in H1299 cells, whereas N-cadherin and vimentin
      expressions were decreased as a result of EHD2 overexpression. Conclusions: Our
      study demonstrated that EHD2 reduces LUAD migration and invasion by preventing
      the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Furthermore, the results
      suggest that EHD2 may be a novel biomarker for prognosis prediction.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study is to describe stereotactic body radiation 
      therapy (SBRT) use, outcomes, hospitalizations and costs compared to patients
      receiving chemotherapy among patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
      (SEER)-Medicare database, we identified patients aged >/=66 with metastatic NSCLC
      treated with SBRT as first-line treatment between 2004 and 2014. Multivariable
      logistic regression identified covariates associated with SBRT. Overall survival 
      (OS) between SBRT and chemotherapy was compared using the Kaplan-Meier estimator 
      and Cox proportional hazards regression. To compare hospitalizations and
      associated costs, we matched patients treated with SBRT to those with comparable 
      prognostic factors receiving chemotherapy. Results: We identified 215 patients
      with metastatic NSCLC who received SBRT and 12,486 patients who received
      chemotherapy as first-line treatment. SBRT use increased from 0.5% to 3% and was 
      associated with older age, female sex, poor disability status, and lower T- and
      N-stage. OS increased with SBRT, female sex, higher income and decreased with
      higher Charlson Comorbidity Score >/=2, poor disability status, higher T-stage
      and higher N-stage. Among a matched sample, SBRT patients underwent fewer
      hospitalizations vs. chemotherapy patients (73% vs. 81%, P=0.02). Among those
      hospitalized, SBRT patients incurred higher hospitalization costs ($33,063 vs.
      $23,865, P<0.001) but costs per month of survival were similar. Conclusions: SBRT
      is increasing among Medicare patients with metastatic NSCLC. Our findings suggest
      that SBRT may play a role in management of select metastatic NSCLC patients in
      addition to standard-of-care chemotherapy.

AB  - Taiwanese surgeons have pioneered major advances in the field of minimally
      invasive thoracic surgery. Since the establishment of the Taiwan Association of
      Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery [1986], the landscape of thoracic surgery has
      rapidly evolved from traditional thoracotomy to multi-port video-assisted
      thoracoscopic approaches. By early 21st century, further developments have
      included the single-port and subxiphoid techniques. This paper provides an
      overview of the Taiwanese thoracic surgery environment and its major
      accomplishments. With the increasing use of low-dose computed tomography for lung
      cancer screening, the detection of small pulmonary nodules has been growing
      steadily. High-end hybrid operating rooms comprising both imaging and surgical
      equipment are increasingly being applied in Taiwan as platforms for image-guided 
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (iVATS). Recently, we described an iVATS
      workflow for simultaneous detection and removal of small pulmonary nodules which 
      was entirely performed by thoracic surgeons. With respect to esophageal
      malignancies, the implementation of robot-assisted esophagectomy has been a
      significant milestone in Taiwan. This technique allowed conducting an extensive
      lymph node dissection along the bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve in a safe and
      effective manner. With 14 medical schools and 26 medical centers located on the
      island, Taiwan has been able to maintain a constant doctor-to-population ratio of
      1-to-500. By partnering with the National Health Insurance and by taking
      advantage of state-of-the-art technologies, Taiwanese thoracic surgeons are
      continuously striving to deliver high-quality and cost-effective surgical care.

      macrophages and selection of immunochemotherapy.
PG  - 2493-2510
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-294 [doi]
AB  - Background: The impact of miR-145-5p in immune infiltration and the potential
      application in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) immunochemotherapy
      remains unknown. Methods: Transcriptomic data for ESCC tissues and normal tissues
      and clinical materials of patients with ESCC were obtained from The Cancer Genome
      Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. The differences in 
      mRNA levels in cancer tissues and noncancerous tissues were analyzed, and we
      subsequently investigated the association between miR-145-5p expression and the
      key parameters of ESCC progression and prognosis. Additionally, cytological
      experiments were performed to evaluate the biological functions of miR-145-5p.
      Pathways potentially affected by miR-145-5p were analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment 
      Analysis (GSEA) and REACTOME. We also analyzed the function of miR-145-5p in
      immune infiltration through the TIMER2 (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource)
      database. Results: The analysis of gene chip data from the TCGA database and GEO 
      database (including GSE13937 and GSE43732) showed that the expression of
      miR-145-5p is downregulated in ESCC (P<0.05) and that patients with high
      miR-145-5p levels had lower survival rates (P<0.05). The expression of miR-145-5p
      was significantly correlated with the disease-free survival (DFS) rate (P<0.05)
      and M stage (P<0.05) in the TCGA database and was significantly correlated with
      the T stage (P<0.05) and TNM stage (P<0.05) in the GSE13937 database. Functional 
      experiments showed that miR-145-5p attenuated proliferation (P<0.05), migration
      (P<0.01) and invasion (P<0.01) in the Eca109 cell line. Both GSEA gene enrichment
      and REACTOME gene enrichment revealed that miR-145-5p was associated with tumor
      signaling pathways and immune signaling pathways. Immune infiltration analysis
      revealed that the expression level of miR-145-5p was significantly correlated
      with the infiltration level of macrophages (P<0.05) and was positively correlated
      with the level of gene markers of M2 macrophages and tumor-associated macrophages
      (P<0.05). Conclusions: MiR-145-5p acts as a tumor suppressor microRNA in ESCC and
      is an important noncoding RNA in the high M2-like tumor-associated macrophage
      infiltration of ESCC. Assessing the miR-145-5p level in ESCC samples has
      translational meaning, which help illustrate the immune infiltration status,
      predict the prognostic outcome, and select the type of immunochemotherapy.

AB  - Until recently, thoracic surgery in France was associated with vascular or
      cardiac surgery. It is now increasingly performed as a specific activity.
      Training of a thoracic surgeon has a common part with cardiovascular surgery
      during a 6-year curriculum including theory and practical practice acquired both 
      by simulation and clinical fellowship. There are 343 board-certified surgeons
      performing thoracic surgery in 147 authorized centers. To be authorized to
      perform thoracic surgery, these centers must have at least 2 qualified surgeons
      and perform a minimum of 40 procedures per year for thoracic cancer. The
      discussion of the cases in a multidisciplinary tumor board (MDTB), validated by a
      written conclusion, is also mandatory and is a prerequisite for operating on
      patient for any cancer. All thoracic surgery procedures are recorded in a
      national database, Epithor. This database gives a precise idea not only of the
      activity but also of operative data, morbidity, mortality and follow-up. In 2023,
      participation to Epithor database will be a prerequisite for the certification of
      thoracic surgeons. Major changes in diagnostic and therapeutic options,
      development and innovations in video-assisted and robotically-assisted surgery,
      forthcoming transbronchial approaches will more likely lead to reorganize
      thoracic surgery with specialized and expert multidisciplinary boards as well as 
      a concentration in high volume centers.

      after lobectomy: a retrospective observational study.
PG  - 2602-2610
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-707 [doi]
AB  - Background: Postoperative fluid management plays a key role in providing adequate
      tissue perfusion, stabilizing hemodynamics, and reducing morbidities related to
      hemodynamics. This study evaluated the dose-response relationship between
      postoperative 24-hour intravenous fluid volume and postoperative outcomes in
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing video-assisted
      thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy. Methods: A retrospective analysis of
      adult patients with NSCLC undergoing VATS lobectomy between May 2016 and April
      2017 was performed. The primary exposure variable was total intravenous
      crystalloid infusion in the 24-hour postoperative period. The observation
      outcomes were postoperative pulmonary complications, acute kidney injury (AKI),
      in-hospital mortality, readmission within 30 days, prolonged hospital stay,
      postoperative length of stay, and total hospital care costs. Univariate and
      multivariate analyses were performed. Results: Of the 563 patients, 136 (24.2%)
      with pulmonary complications were observed. Binary logistics regression showed
      that, relative to the group with moderate postoperative 24-hour crystalloid
      infusion, the risk for postoperative pulmonary complications was significantly
      increased in the restrictive [odds ratio (OR) 1.815, 95% CI: 1.083-3.043;
      P=0.024] and liberal (OR 2.692, 95% CI: 1.684-4.305; P<0.001) groups.
      Conclusions: In patients with NSCLC undergoing VATS lobectomy, both restrictive
      and liberal 24-hour postoperative crystalloid infusions were related to adverse
      effects on postoperative outcomes and the optimal volume of 24-hour postoperative
      intravenous crystalloid infusion was 1,080-<1,410 mL.

TI  - Impact of the extent of lung resection on postoperative outcomes of pulmonary
      metastasectomy for colorectal cancer metastases: an exploratory systematic
      review.
PG  - 2677-2688
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-239 [doi]
AB  - Background: Pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) with curative intent has become a
      widely accepted treatment for lung metastases from solid tumours in selected
      patients, with low perioperative morbidity and mortality. In particular, PM is
      strongly recommended in selected patients with secondary lesions from colorectal 
      cancer (CRC), due to its excellent postoperative prognosis. Nevertheless, the
      impact of the extent of PM on recurrence and survival remains controversial. This
      review aimed at assessing differences in short- and long-term postoperative
      outcomes depending on the extent of lung resection for lung metastases. Methods: 
      A systematic literature review of studies comparing anatomical and non-anatomical
      resections of lung metastases was performed (Prospective Register of Systematic
      Reviews Registration: 254931). A literature search for articles published in
      English between the date of database inception and January 31, 2021 was performed
      in EMBASE (via Ovid), MEDLINE (via PubMed) and Cochrane CENTRAL. Retrospective
      studies, randomised and non-randomised controlled trials were included. The
      Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to determine the risk of bias for the
      primary outcome for included studies. Results: Out of 432 papers, three
      retrospective non-randomised studies (1,342 patients) were selected for
      systematic reviewing. Although our search design did not exclude any primary
      tumour histology, all selected studies investigated surgical resection of lung
      metastases from CRC. Because of variations in the compared surgical approaches to
      pulmonary metastases, a meta-analysis proved unfeasible. There was a tendency to 
      perform anatomical resections for larger metastases. Multivariate analyses
      revealed that anatomical resections were protective for recurrence-free survival 
      (RFS), while the impact of such procedures on overall survival (OS) remained
      uncertain. A significantly higher incidence of resection-margin recurrences was
      observed in patients who underwent non-anatomical resections. Discussion:
      Anatomical resections of lung metastases from CRC seem to be associated with
      improved RFS. However, well-constructed comparative clinical trials focusing on
      the extent of PM are needed.

      score matching study.
PG  - 2635-2644
LID - 10.21037/jtd-22-754 [doi]
AB  - Background: It is unclear whether hybrid video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
      (VATS) sleeve lobectomy (SL) could be an alternative to thoracotomy SL for
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of hybrid VATS SL. Methods: We collected 112 
      patients who received hybrid VATS SL or thoracotomy SL for primary treatment of
      NSCLC at Liaoning Cancer Hospital & Institute from November 2016 to September
      2021. Perioperative and survival data were collected, and retrospective analysis 
      was conducted on 91 thoracotomy and 21 hybrid VATS SL patients to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of two approaches. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used
      to minimize selection bias. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied to compare
      overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Follow-up data were
      obtained by outpatient clinical visit and nurse-led telephone. Results: A total
      of 112 patients were included in this study, including thoracotomy patients
      (n=91) and hybrid VATS patients (n=21). In the non-match analysis, the baseline
      data of patients was similar between the two groups, except regarding the receipt
      of neoadjuvant therapy (P=0.087). After PSM (2:1), a total of 39 thoracotomy
      patients and 19 hybrid VATS patients were enrolled. The baseline variables were
      quite similar in both groups. In the hybrid group, the number of lymph nodes
      (25.9+/-8.5 vs. 32.9+/-9.7, P<0.01) and positive lymph nodes (3.7+/-2.9 vs.
      5.6+/-4.0, P=0.045) were significantly higher than those in the thoracotomy
      group. The hybrid group was associated with significantly shorter postoperative
      hospital stay (9.5+/-3.5 vs. 7.3+/-2.9, P=0.021) and chest tube duration time
      (6.6+/-3.1 vs. 5.3+/-1.5, P=0.031). No statistical difference in complications,
      reoperation, and recurrence were observed between the hybrid VATS SL and
      thoracotomy SL (P=1.0, P=1.0, P=0.472). The 30- and 90-day mortalities showed no 
      differences between approaches (2.6% vs. 0%, P=1.0; 5.1% vs. 5.3%, P=1.0). No
      significant differences were found between thoracotomy and hybrid VATS SL in
      3-year OS (P=0.614) and 3-year RFS (P=0.750). Conclusions: Hybrid VATS SL
      lobectomy may be a safe and feasible approach associated with similar oncologic
      prognosis and better postoperative recovery compared with thoracotomy SL for
      NSCLC treatment.

AB  - Background and purpose: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been proven to 
      be beneficial for several disease sites in the (lower) abdomen. However, the
      quality of the treatment plan, based on a single planning computed tomography
      (CT), can be compromised due to large inter-fraction motion of the target and
      organs at risk (OARs) in this anatomical region. The aim of this study was to
      investigate the feasibility of online adaptive SBRT treatments on a robotic
      radiosurgery system and to record estimated total treatment times. Materials and 
      methods: For two disease sites, locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) and
      oligometastatic lymph nodes, four patients with repeat CTs were included in the
      feasibility study. Quick treatment plan templates were generated based on the
      planning CT and validated by running them on the plan and fraction CTs. For two
      cases a dummy run was performed and the individual steps were timed. Dose
      delivery was the largest contributor to the total treatment time, followed by
      contour adaptation. Results: Running the quick plan templates resulted in plans
      similar to unrestricted plans, obeying the OAR constraints. The dummy runs showed
      that online adaptive treatments were completed in 64 to 83 min respectively for
      oligometastases and LAPC, comparable to other clinically available solutions.
      Conclusions: This study showed the feasibility of online re-planning for two
      challenging disease sites within a clinically acceptable time frame on a robotic 
      radiosurgery system, making use of commercially available elements that are not
      integrated by the vendor.

AB  - Epidemiologic evidence documenting risk of chronic diseases as children with
      cerebral palsy age throughout growth is lacking to inform prevention strategies. 
      The objective was to characterize the 5-year risk of chronic diseases that are
      typically associated with advanced aging among < 1-13 year olds with cerebral
      palsy and effects by patient-level factors. This retrospective cohort study used 
      nationwide commercial administrative claims from 01/01/2001-12/31/2018 from
      children < 1-13 years old with >/= 5 years of mostly continuous insurance
      enrollment. The 5-year risk of chronic diseases was examined for the entire
      cohort with and without cerebral palsy and then by baseline age group (<1-2, 3-5,
      6-8, 9-11, 12-13 years old), including cardiorespiratory, metabolic, kidney, and 
      liver diseases, cancer, depression, and osteoarthritis. For cerebral palsy, the
      association between 5-year chronic disease rate and patient-level factors was
      assessed using Cox regression. Children with (n = 5,559) vs without (n = 2.3
      million) cerebral palsy had a higher 5-year risk of all chronic diseases when
      comparing the entire cohorts (relative risk, 1.19 to 64.26, all P < 0.05) and
      most chronic diseases when comparing cohorts for each age group. Among children
      with cerebral palsy, there were effects by gender, co-occurring intellectual
      disabilities and/or epilepsy, and wheelchair use for some chronic diseases, which
      can help to identify at-risk children. This study provides novel epidemiologic
      evidence of 5-year risk of "adult-onset" chronic diseases for children with
      cerebral palsy during important developmental stages, and associated
      patient-level factors (to enhance clinical detection). Findings may inform when
      to implement prevention strategies and who may be more at risk.

LID - 10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101922 [doi]
AB  - We aimed to examine poverty and rurality as potential predictors of cancer health
      disparities. This cross-sectional study used data from the Florida Cancer Data
      System on all cancer diagnoses in the years 2014-2018 to determine age-adjusted
      incidence and mortality (per 100,000 population) for the 22 most common cancer
      sites within rural and urban counties, and high poverty and low poverty
      communities. Rural/urban and high/low poverty related cancer disparities were
      tested for statistical significance using the Rate Ratio statistical test.
      Overall cancer incidence was significantly lower in rural areas than in urban,
      but significantly higher in high poverty communities. Rurality and poverty were
      both associated with disparity in cancer incidence risk for tobacco-related
      cancers. The overall mortality was 22% higher in high poverty areas compared to
      low poverty areas. Ten cancer sites had mortality disparity from 83% to 17%
      higher in high poverty areas. Only three cancer sites, all tobacco-related, had
      higher mortality in rural areas than urban areas, demonstrating the
      intersectional nature of inhaled and smokeless tobacco use in rural low-income
      communities. Cancer and mortality rates in rural and urban areas may be largely
      driven by poverty. The high disparities related to high poverty areas reflects
      poor access to preventative care and treatment. Low income communities, rural or 
      urban, will require focused efforts to address challenges specific to each
      population.

TI  - Upregulation of CCNB2 and Its Perspective Mechanisms in Cerebral Ischemic Stroke 
      and All Subtypes of Lung Cancer: A Comprehensive Study.
PG  - 854540
LID - 10.3389/fnint.2022.854540 [doi]
AB  - Cyclin B2 (CCNB2) belongs to type B cell cycle family protein, which is located
      on chromosome 15q22, and it binds to cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to regulate 
      their activities. In this study, 103 high-throughput datasets related to all
      subtypes of lung cancer (LC) and cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS) with the data of 
      CCNB2 expression were collected. The analysis of standard mean deviation (SMD)
      and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) reflecting expression status
      demonstrated significant up-regulation of CCNB2 in LC and CIS (Lung
      adenocarcinoma: SMD = 1.40, 95%CI [0.98-1.83], SROC = 0.92, 95%CI [0.89-0.94].
      Lung squamous cell carcinoma: SMD = 2.56, 95%CI [1.64-3.48]. SROC = 0.97, 95%CI
      [0.95-0.98]. Lung small cell carcinoma: SMD = 3.01, 95%CI [2.01-4.01]. SROC =
      0.98, 95%CI [0.97-0.99]. CIS: SMD = 0.29, 95%CI [0.05-0.53], SROC = 0.68, 95%CI
      [0.63-0.71]). Simultaneously, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis
      indicated that CCNB2 is the hub molecule of crossed high-expressed genes in CIS
      and LC. Through Multiscale embedded gene co-expression network analysis (MEGENA),
      a gene module of CIS including 76 genes was obtained and function enrichment
      analysis of the CCNB2 module genes implied that CCNB2 may participate in the
      processes in the formation of CIS and tissue damage caused by CIS, such as "cell 
      cycle," "protein kinase activity," and "glycosphingolipid biosynthesis."
      Afterward, via single-cell RNA-seq analysis, CCNB2 was found up-regulated on
      GABAergic neurons in brain organoids as well as T cells expressing proliferative 
      molecules in LUAD. Concurrently, the expression of CCNB2 distributed similarly to
      TOP2A as a module marker of cell proliferation in cell cluster. These findings
      can help in the field of the pathogenesis of LC-related CIS and neuron repair
      after CIS damage.

      impacting diagnosis of a solitary pulmonary nodule: a case report.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.21037/acr-22-5 [doi]
AB  - Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men
      and women throughout the world. Historically, bronchoscopy played a limited role 
      in pulmonary nodule management due to a limited diagnostic accuracy. With the
      emergence of robotic bronchoscopy, proceduralists can now navigate to more
      peripheral lesions completely extrinsic to the airways with increased diagnostic 
      yield. Despite the increased diagnostic yield from robotic-assisted bronchoscopy,
      challenges in exact localization of the lesion during a procedure can occur. This
      case highlights a novel use of robotic bronchoscopy combined with mobile
      three-dimensional (3D) imaging to optimize lesion location for biopsy previously 
      not reported in the literature. Case Description: We describe a case where the
      combination of robotic bronchoscopy with new mobile 3D imaging was essential for 
      the accurate biopsy of an incidentally found pulmonary nodule in a 72-year-old
      woman. Initial navigation to the nodule using robotic bronchoscopy resulted in
      the catheter being inferior to the area of interest. After renavigation using the
      information provided by mobile 3D imaging, we were able to confirmed
      tool-in-lesion prior to biopsy. The patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma
      with papillary features and underwent a lobectomy with a favorable prognosis.
      Conclusions: A diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was made for this patient utilizing
      the novel combined technique of robotic peripheral pulmonary nodule biopsy with
      portable 3D imaging, which may improve overall diagnostic accuracy of
      bronchoscopic biopsy.

TI  - Incidental paratracheal lymph node lung adenocarcinoma in a patient with goiter: 
      a case report.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.21037/acr-22-23 [doi]
AB  - Background: Paratracheal lymph nodes can be sites of metastasis for a variety of 
      malignancies, but these metastases are treated differently depending on the
      tissue of origin. We describe a patient who underwent combined thoracoscopic and 
      cervical resection of a multinodular goiter who was found to have incidental lung
      adenocarcinoma in an adjacent paratracheal lymph node despite having no pulmonary
      nodules. Case Description: A 62-year-old male with longstanding substernal
      multinodular goiter presented to his primary care doctor with continued growth of
      his goiter. After repeatedly declining surgery, he became amenable to resection
      and underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic and cervical approaches. An
      incidentally found separate large right paratracheal lymph node was also
      discovered and completely resected. Final pathology of the thyroid mass revealed 
      hyperplastic thyroid nodules consistent with a benign goiter. However, the
      separate right paratracheal lymph node revealed a thyroid transcription factor
      1-positive (TTF-1) specimen concerning for lung adenocarcinoma in the absence of 
      pulmonary nodules on imaging. Conclusions: Noteworthy to this case is the
      minimally invasive thoracoscopic approach preventing the need for median
      sternotomy and preventing any increased morbidity for the patient's incidentally 
      found TxN3M0 lung adenocarcinoma. The patient could have been spared resection of
      the lymph node given its pulmonary origin as the standard of care for stage IIIB 
      non-small cell lung cancer is definitive chemoradiation and adjuvant
      immunotherapy.

TI  - Heat shock proteins: Biological functions, pathological roles, and therapeutic
      opportunities.
PG  - e161
LID - 10.1002/mco2.161 [doi]
AB  - The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are ubiquitous and conserved protein families in
      both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and they maintain cellular
      proteostasis and protect cells from stresses. HSP protein families are classified
      based on their molecular weights, mainly including large HSPs, HSP90, HSP70,
      HSP60, HSP40, and small HSPs. They function as molecular chaperons in cells and
      work as an integrated network, participating in the folding of newly synthesized 
      polypeptides, refolding metastable proteins, protein complex assembly,
      dissociating protein aggregate dissociation, and the degradation of misfolded
      proteins. In addition to their chaperone functions, they also play important
      roles in cell signaling transduction, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulation.
      Therefore, malfunction of HSPs is related with many diseases, including cancers, 
      neurodegeneration, and other diseases. In this review, we describe the current
      understandings about the molecular mechanisms of the major HSP families including
      HSP90/HSP70/HSP60/HSP110 and small HSPs, how the HSPs keep the protein
      proteostasis and response to stresses, and we also discuss their roles in
      diseases and the recent exploration of HSP related therapy and diagnosis to
      modulate diseases. These research advances offer new prospects of HSPs as
      potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Primary Cervical Carcinosarcoma: Report of a Rare Case.
PG  - e174-e178
LID - 10.1055/s-0042-1744152 [doi]
AB  - Background Carcinosarcomas are malignant mixed Mullerian tumors (MMMT),
      containing both epithelial and mesenchymal components. Carcinosarcomas of the
      uterine cervix comprise an extremely rare histopathological entity, with less
      than 150 cases reported in the literature to date. Materials and Methods A
      79-year-old postmenopausal female patient was referred to our gynecological
      department due to a pelvic mass and vaginal bleeding. A cervical curettage was
      performed and the histological report revealed a malignant neoplasm with high
      cellularity consisting of two components; the first was a chondrosarcoma and the 
      latter a adenocarcinoma. A diagnosis of MMMT was confirmed through
      immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy
      were implemented, and a year later the patient underwent a radical hysterectomy
      and oncological pelvic lymph node dissection. She remains disease-free 12 months 
      postoperatively. Conclusion Primary cervical carcinosarcomas are extremely rare
      tumors demonstrating a bipartite profile. Preoperative diagnosis with appropriate
      immunochemistry testing of this rare entity is crucial to decision making.

AB  - The existence of precursor lesions for invasive cervical cancer has been
      recognized for more than 50 years. Our understanding of the pathobiology and
      behavior of cervical cancer precursors has evolved considerably over the past
      five decades. Furthermore, the terminology used to classify pre-invasive lesions 
      of the cervix has frequently changed. The realization that human papillomavirus
      (HPV) infections constitute a morphologic continuum has prompted efforts to
      include them within a single classification system, specifically the squamous
      intraepithelial lesions (SILs) which have now been embraced by the surgical
      pathologists. The reduced number of specific pathological categories has made
      clinical decision-making more straightforward. The generic criteria for SIL have 
      two important histological parameters: Alterations in the density of superficial 
      epithelial cells and superficial squamous atypia. The flat condyloma or cervical 
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I is generally associated with intermediate and
      high-risk HPV types as against the low-risk viruses that cause
      exophytic/papillary growth patterns of condylomas. The diagnosis of low-grade SIL
      (LSIL) (flat and exophytic condylomas) requires first excluding benign mimics of 
      LSIL and second to confirm the characteristic cytologic atypia. For high-grade
      SILs (HSILs), the extent and degree of atypia generally exceed the limits of that
      described in flat or exophytic condylomas (LSILs). Less maturation, abnormal cell
      differentiation, loss of cell polarity, and increased mitotic index with abnormal
      mitotic figures occupying increasing thickness of the epithelium define a lesion 
      as CIN II or CIN III. Atypical immature metaplasia associated with inflammation
      and atrophy is a challenge in cervical biopsy interpretation. Careful attention
      to the growth pattern of the epithelium, the distribution of the atypia, nuclear 
      spacing, and the degree of anisokaryosis and the presence of enlarged
      hyperchromatic nuclei help in differentiating a non-neoplastic from a neoplastic 
      process. This chapter describes in depth the diagnostic difficulties in the
      interpretation of cervical biopsies. It also provides useful criteria in
      distinguishing benign mimics from true precancerous lesions and the role of
      biomarkers such as the p16ink4 and Ki-67 in the differential diagnosis of
      precursor lesions and the reactive and metaplastic epithelium.

TI  - Role of colposcopy in the management of women with abnormal cytology.

LID - 10.25259/CMAS_03_15_2021 [doi]
AB  - Cytology identifies the women who are at higher risk of harboring high-grade
      cervical premalignant lesions or invasive cancer. However, a diagnostic test such
      as colposcopy is crucial for women with abnormal cytology for localization of the
      abnormality, confirmation of diagnosis, and appropriate management. To
      standardize this subjective technique and to minimize the interobserver
      variations, Swede scoring system was introduced. The revised colposcopic
      nomenclature of the International Federation of Cervical Pathology and Colposcopy
      in 2011 included various normal and abnormal colposcopic findings and gives a
      description of colposcopic features which improves its accuracy over the
      colposcopic indices. There is consensus agreement that cytology indicative of
      high-grade lesions (ASC-H and HSIL in the Bethesda system) should engender
      immediate referral for colposcopy and biopsy. The management of women who have
      equivocal or borderline cytology of low-grade abnormalities (ASCUS/LSIL) is still
      under deliberation. It is generally agreed to have an HPV triage for women with
      equivocal cytology. Based on the latest recommendations, the current chapter
      provides an extensive overview of the role of colposcopy in the management of
      women with various abnormalities reported on Pap smear.

TI  - Role of immunocytochemistry in cervical cancer screening.
PG  - 42
LID - 10.25259/CMAS_03_17_2022 [doi]
AB  - The cervical cancer screening has been based conventionally on cytologic
      analysis. With advances in understanding the role of human papillomavirus,
      cotesting has been applied. But most of the patients subjected to colposcopy did 
      not benefit, except in cases with HSIL [high-grade squamous intraepithelial
      lesion] cytology. Because of this, a step to increase the sensitivity to detect
      cancers and pre-cancers but with higher specificity with minimal overdiagnosis
      leading to prevention of unindicated cervical biopsies is highly desired. Such
      triaging step in cases with abnormal screening results is expected to minimize
      invasive interventions because of low false positivity. With availability of
      methodologies leading to quantitatively and qualitatively enhanced cell-blocks
      from residual liquid based cytology specimens, immunostaining can be performed
      for multiple immunomarkers with potential objectivity to triage initial screening
      test results. This is enhanced further with inclusion of AV marker in the
      cell-blocks and application of SCIP (subtractive coordinate immunoreactivity
      pattern) approach. The cell-blocks are also resource for performing other
      ancillary studies including molecular pathology and proteomics/metabolomics as
      potential tests in future. This review explores application of residual liquid
      based cytology specimen for cell-blocking with application of ancillary studies
      in algorithmic manner as adjunct to ASCCP management guidelines for improved
      patient care.

PG  - 39
LID - 10.25259/CMAS_03_14_2021 [doi]
AB  - Carcinoma of cervix is classified as per the WHO classification into primary
      tumors which are predominantly epithelial tumors, mesenchymal tumors and tumor
      like lesions, mixed epithelial stromal tumors, melanocytic, germ cell, and
      lymphoid tumors. Secondary tumors are uncommon. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 
      various morphological forms needs to be separated from other epithelial tumors
      for treatment modality selection. Majority of SCC are human papilloma virus (HPV)
      positive. The histological pattern, HPV type, and grading do not affect
      prognosis. Mixed mesenchymal and epithelial tumors are of Mullerian origin. Among
      sarcomas, Botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma needs to be looked for, as a small biopsy may
      miss it. Carcinoma cervix is not the only cancer caused by HPV. High-risk HPV is 
      implicated in causation of various other cancers such as anal cancers,
      oropharyngeal cancers, vulval cancers, vaginal cancers, and penile cancers.
      Low-risk HPV viruses similarly cause infections of perianal and genital region in
      males and females. The terminology for these lesions has evolved before
      understanding of pathogenesis of low- and high-risk HPV. The lower anogenital
      squamous terminology (LAST), an acronym for LAST, incorporates the low- and
      high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) terminology. In invasive
      cancers, a superficially invasive SCC is a well-defined entity. LAST outlines
      areas where p16 use is recommended. No benefit of addition of other biomarkers
      like p63 or ki67 is found in problem-solving in differentiation of HSIL from
      mimics or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Routine use of biomarkers is
      not advocated.

PG  - 22799036221106542

AB  - Background: Unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, alcohol and tobacco consumption
      are among the leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases. It is estimated
      that around 40% of cancers could be prevented by adopting healthy lifestyles.
      Design and methods: The Stili di Vita (Sti.Vi) study was a randomized study for
      assessing the impact of healthy lifestyle interventions on anthropometric
      measures, metabolic parameters, and health outcomes among participants of cancer 
      screening programs in Turin (Italy). Eligible women aged 50-54 years, invited to 
      biennial mammography screening, and 58-years-old men and women, invited to a
      once-only sigmoidoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening were randomly
      allocated to Diet group (DG), Physical Activity group (PAG), Physical Activity
      plus Diet group (PADG), or control group (CG). Physical and eating habits,
      metabolic and anthropometric measurements, repeatedly collected, were the study
      outcomes. The active intervention, offered to participants assigned to the DG,
      PAG, and PADG arms, consisted of a basic module and an advanced module. The
      effect of the interventions was estimated through logistic regression or a
      difference in differences approach. A multiple imputation procedure was
      implemented to deal with missing values and q-values have been calculated in the 
      presence of multiple hypothesis testing. Results: Out of the 8442 screened
      attendees, 1270 signed informed consent, while 1125 participants accomplished the
      baseline visit. Participants were equally distributed across the four treatments 
      as following: 273 (24.3%) in DG, 288 (25.6%) in the PAG, 283 (25.1%) in PADG, and
      281 (25%) in the CG. Participants assigned to DG or PADG increased their
      consumption of whole grains (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.20-2.60 and OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 
      1.06-2.27, respectively) and legumes (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12-2.79 and OR = 2.24,
      95% CI: 1.41-3.57, respectively), with respect to CG. The participants randomized
      to DG reduced processed meat and increased fruit consumption (OR = 2.57, 95% CI: 
      1.76-3.76 and OR = 2.38, 95% CI: 1.12-5.06, respectively). The effects were more 
      evident in the CRC screening subgroup. No relevant difference was observed
      between PAG and CG. No impact was observed on physical activity habits.
      Conclusions: Our findings suggest that active interventions can increase
      awareness and induce diet changes. However, participation rate and compliance to 
      the courses was quite low, innovative strategies to enhance participants'
      retention are needed, with the ultimate goal of increasing awareness and inducing
      positive lifestyle changes.

TI  - Spending and Hospital Stay for Melanoma in Hunan, China.
PG  - 917119
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.917119 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to describe the economic burden of Chinese patients
      with melanoma in Hunan province of China, and to investigate the factors for
      hospitalization spending and length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing melanoma
      surgery. Methods: Data was extracted from the Chinese National Health Statistics 
      Network Reporting System database in Hunan province during 2017-2019. Population 
      and individual statistics were presented, and nonparametric tests and quantile
      regression were used to analyze the factors for spending and LOS. Result: A total
      of 2,644 hospitalized patients with melanoma in Hunan were identified. During
      2017-2019, the total hospitalization spending was $5,247,972, and out-of-pocket
      payment (OOP) was $1,817,869, accounting for 34.6% of the total expenditure. The 
      median spending was $1,123 [interquartile range (IQR): $555-2,411] per capita,
      and the median LOS was 10 days (IQR: 5-18). A total of 1,104 patients who
      underwent surgery were further analyzed. The non-parametric tests and quantile
      regression showed that women were associated with less spending and LOS than men.
      In general, patients aged 46-65 and those with lesions on the limbs had higher
      hospitalization costs and LOS than other subgroups. Conclusion: Melanoma causes
      heavy economic burdens on patients in Hunan, such that the median spending is
      close to 60% of the averagely annual disposable income. Middle-aged men patients 
      with melanoma on the limbs present the highest financial burden of melanoma.

AB  - Background: Alternative and complementary therapies have been gaining popularity 
      as ways to reduce anxiety in patients. Aim: This study aimed to assess whether
      yoga and meditation could decrease the severity of anxiety in Indian women
      diagnosed with infertility Study. Study Setting and Design: This was a
      retrospective data analysis of anxiety score of 354 women undergoing treatment at
      a tertiary infertility hospital between January 2016 and December 2018. Materials
      and Method: Women participated in group yoga, meditation and counselling therapy 
      intervention during their treatment period. A self-reported questionnaire that
      used the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 criteria measured the participants'
      severity of anxiety at the start of and again at the end of the intervention.
      Statistical Analysis: Demographic analysis and a two-tailed paired t-test were
      applied between groups. Results: The results indicated that there was a
      statistically significant mean reduction (7.3 +/- 2.7) in the anxiety scores of
      the participants between entry (12.94 +/- 2.65) and following exposure (5.39 +/- 
      1.99) to the intervention (P < 0.0001). The mean reduction in scores remained
      similar between participants who received </=6 sessions (7.50 +/- 2.68) and
      participants who received >6 sessions (7.10 +/- 2.64) (P > 0.05). Among the
      participants that experienced mild anxiety at baseline (n = 43), 72.1% (n = 31)
      reported experiencing minimal anxiety following the intervention (P < 0.0001).
      Among those that experienced moderate anxiety at baseline (n = 213), 32.4% (n =
      69) reported experiencing minimal anxiety post-intervention (P < 0.0001).
      Participants who expressed severe anxiety at baseline (n = 94, 26.6%), reported
      experiencing minimal anxiety (13.8% [n = 13)], mild anxiety (81.9% [n = 77]) and 
      moderate anxiety (4.3% [n = 4]) after exposure to the intervention (P < 0.0001). 
      None of the participants reported experiencing severe anxiety post-intervention. 
      Conclusion: The benefits of alternative anxiety-reduction therapies for women
      diagnosed with infertility have been demonstrated in this study. These therapies 
      can be used to complement the routine treatment of such patients.

      immunotoxins: an antibody engineering perspective.
PG  - 164-176

AB  - Targeted cancer therapies using immunotoxins have achieved remarkable efficacy in
      hematological malignancies. However, the clinical development of immunotoxins is 
      also faced with many challenges like anti-drug antibodies and dose-limiting
      toxicity issues. Such a poor efficacy or safety ratio is also the major hurdle in
      the research and development of antibody-drug conjugates. From an antibody
      engineering perspective, various strategies were summarized or proposed to tackle
      the notorious on-target off-tumor toxicity issues, including passive strategy
      (XTENylation of immunotoxins) and active strategies (modulating the affinity and 
      valency of the targeting moiety of immunotoxins, conditionally activating
      immunotoxins in the tumor microenvironments and reconstituting split toxin to
      reduce systemic toxicity, etc.). By modulating the functional characteristics of 
      the targeting moiety and the toxic moiety of immunotoxins, selective tumor
      targeting can be augmented while sparing the healthy cells in normal tissues
      expressing the same target of interest. If successful, the improved therapeutic
      index will likely help to address the dose-limiting toxicities commonly observed 
      in the clinical trials of various immunotoxins.

TI  - Identification and Validation of a Three Pyroptosis-Related lncRNA Signature for 
      Prognosis Prediction in Lung Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 838624
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.838624 [doi]
AB  - Pyroptosis, defined as programmed cell death, results in the release of
      inflammatory mediators. Recent studies have revealed that pyroptosis plays
      essential roles in antitumor immunity and immunotherapy efficacy. Long noncoding 
      RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in a variety of biological behaviors in tumor cells, 
      although the roles and mechanisms of lncRNAs in pyroptosis are rarely studied.
      Our study aimed to establish a novel pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature as a
      forecasting tool for predicting prognosis and ascertaining immune value. Based on
      lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we
      performed Pearson's correlation analysis to identify pyroptosis-related lncRNAs. 
      After differentially expressed gene analysis and univariate Cox regression
      analysis, we selected prognosis-related and differentially expressed lncRNAs.
      Finally, we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis to establish the three
      pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analyses and
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated the excellent
      performance for predicting the prognosis of LUAD patients. At the same time, we
      applied multidimensional approaches to further explore the functional enrichment,
      tumor microenvironment (TME) landscape, and immunotherapy efficacy among the
      different risk groups. A nomogram was constructed by integrating risk scores and 
      clinical characteristics, which was validated using calibrations and ROC curves. 
      Three lncRNAs, namely, AC090559.1, AC034102.8, and AC026355.2, were involved in
      this signature and used to classify LUAD patients into low- and high-risk groups.
      Overall survival time (OS) was higher in the low-risk group than in the high-risk
      group, which was also validated in our LUAD cohort from Shandong Provincial
      Hospital. TME landscape analyses revealed that a higher abundance of infiltrating
      immune cells and a greater prevalence of immune-related events existed in the
      low-risk group. Meanwhile, higher expression of immune checkpoint (ICP) genes,
      higher immunophenoscore (IPSs), and greater T cell dysfunction in the low-risk
      group demonstrated a better response to immunotherapy than the high-risk group.
      Combined with predictions from the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) 
      website, we found that LUAD patients in the low-risk group significantly
      benefited from programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
      therapy compared with those in the high-risk group. Furthermore, drug
      susceptibility analysis identified potential sensitive chemotherapeutic drugs for
      each risk group. In this study, a novel three pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature
      was constructed, which could accurately predict the immunotherapy efficacy and
      prognosis in LUAD patients.

      Colorectal Cancer Identified FJX1 as a Novel Biomarker.
PG  - 960954
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.960954 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality have increased in recent years, with
      more than half of patients who died of colorectal cancer developing liver
      metastases. Consequently, colorectal cancer liver metastasis is the focus of
      clinical treatment, as well as being the most difficult. The primary target genes
      related to colorectal cancer liver metastasis were via bioinformatics analysis.
      First, five prognosis-related genes, CTAG1A, CSTL1, FJX1, IER5L, and KLHL35, were
      identified through screening, and the prognosis of the CSTL1, FJX1, IER5L, and
      KLHL35 high expression group was considerably poorer than that of the low
      expression group. Furthermore, the clinical correlation analysis revealed that in
      distinct pathological stages T, N, and M, the mRNA expression levels of CSTL1,
      IER5L, and KLHL35 were higher than in normal tissues. Finally, a correlation
      study of the above genes and clinical manifestations revealed that FJX1 was
      strongly linked to colorectal cancer liver metastasis. FJX1 is thought to affect 
      chromogenic modification enzymes, the Notch signaling system, cell senescence,
      and other signaling pathways, according to KEGG enrichment analysis. FJX1 may be 
      a critical target in colorectal cancer metastasis, and thus has the potential as 
      a new biomarker to predict and treat colorectal cancer liver metastases.

AB  - Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the malignant tumors worldwide. Janus
      (JAK)-signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway
      is involved in cellular biological process and immune function. However, the
      association between them is still not systematically described. Therefore, in
      this study, we aimed to identify key genes involved in JAK-STAT signaling pathway
      and GC, as well as the potential mechanism. Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas
      (TCGA) database was the source of RNA-sequencing data of GC patients. Gene
      Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used as the validation set. The predictive 
      value of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway-related prognostic prediction model was
      examined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO); survival,
      univariate, and multivariate Cox regression analyses; and receiver operating
      characteristic curve (ROC) analyses to examine the predictive value of the model.
      Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and chi-square test
      were used to verify the expression of genes in the model and assess the
      association between the genes and clinicopathological parameters of GC patients, 
      respectively. Then, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
      (KEGG), gene set enrichment analysis, version 3.0 (GSEA), sequence-based RNA
      adenosine methylation site predictor (SRAMP) online websites, and RNA
      immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments were used to predict the model-related
      potential pathways, m6A modifications, and the association between model genes
      and m6A. Results: A four-gene prognostic model (GHR, PIM1, IFNA8, and IFNB1) was 
      constructed, namely, riskScore. The Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that patients
      with high riskScore expression had a poorer prognosis than those with low
      riskScore expression (p = 0.006). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed
      that the model could be an independent predictor (p < 0.001; HR = 3.342, 95%, CI 
      = 1.834-6.088). The 5-year area under time-dependent ROC curve (AUC) reached
      0.655. The training test set verified these results. Further analyses unveiled an
      enrichment of cancer-related pathways, m6A modifications, and the direct
      interaction between m6A and the four genes. Conclusion: This four-gene prognostic
      model could be applied to predict the prognosis of GC patients and might be a
      promising therapeutic target in GC.

PG  - 888051
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.888051 [doi]
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to identify the hub gene in gastric cancer (GC)
      tumorigenesis. A biomarker prediction model was constructed and analyzed, and
      protein expression in histopathological samples was verified in a validation
      cohort. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from GC
      projects in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Functional enrichment
      analysis of DEGs was performed between the high- and low- Ribonuclease P protein 
      subunit p30 (RPP30) expression groups. ROC analysis was performed to assess RPP30
      expression to discriminate GC from normal tissues. Functional enrichment pathways
      and immune infiltration of DEGs were analyzed using GSEA and ssGSEA. Survival
      analysis and nomogram construction were performed to predict patient survival.
      Immunohistochemical staining of GC tissues was performed to validate RPP30
      expression in GC and paracancerous samples. Results: Gene expression data and
      clinical information of 380 cases (375 GC samples and 32 para-cancerous tissues) 
      were collected from TCGA database. The AUC for RPP30 expression was found to be
      0.785. The G alpha S signaling pathway was the most significantly enriched
      signaling pathway. Primary therapy outcome (p < 0.001, HR = 0.243, 95% CI =
      0.156-0.379), age (p = 0.012, HR = 1.748, 95% CI = 1.133-2.698), and RPP30
      expression (p < 0.001, HR = 2.069, 95% CI = 1.346-3.181) were identified as
      independent prognostic factors. As a quantitative approach, a nomogram
      constructed based on RPP30 expression, age, and primary therapy outcome performed
      well in predicting patient survival. Nineteen of the 25 tissue samples from the
      validation cohort showed positive RPP30 expression in GC tissues, whereas 16
      cases showed negative RPP30 staining in normal tissues. The difference between
      the two was statistically significant. Conclusion: High RPP30 expression was
      significantly correlated with disease progression and poor survival in GC,
      promoting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis via tRNA dysregulation. This study
      provides new and promising insights into the molecular pathogenesis of tRNA in
      GC.

AB  - Tripartite motif-containing genes (TRIMs), with a ubiquitin ligase's function,
      play critical roles in antitumor immunity by activating tumor-specific immune
      responses and stimulating tumor proliferation, thus affecting patient outcomes.
      However, the expression pattern and prognostic values of TRIMs in breast cancer
      (BC) are not well clarified. In this study, several datasets and software were
      integrated to perform a comprehensive analysis of the expression pattern in TRIMs
      and investigate their prognosis values in BC. We found that TRIM59/46 were
      significantly upregulated and TRIM66/52-AS1/68/7/2/9/29 were decreased in BC and 
      validated them using an independent cohort. The expression of numerous TRIMs are 
      significantly correlated with BC molecular subtypes, but not with tumor stages or
      patient age at diagnosis. Higher expression of TRIM3/14/69/45 and lower
      expressions of TRIM68/2 were associated with better overall survival in BC using 
      the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model
      identified TRIM45 as an independent prognostic marker. Further analysis of
      single-cell RNA-seq data revealed that most TRIMs are also expressed in nontumor 
      cells. Higher expression of some TRIMs in the immune or stromal cells suggests an
      important role of TRIMs in the BC microenvironment. Functional enrichment of the 
      co-expression genes indicates that they may be involved in muscle contraction and
      interferon-gamma signaling pathways. In brief, through the analysis, we provided 
      several TRIMs that may contribute to the tumor progression and TRIM45 as a
      potential new prognostic biomarker for BC.

LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.900124 [doi]
AB  - Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (CTHRC1), highly expressed in multiple 
      human solid tumors, has been identified as a tumor associated protein. However,
      its specific role and mechanism with immune infiltrates in gastric cancer are
      still unclear. In this study, we systematically explored and validated the
      expression and prognostic value of CTHRC1 in gastric cancer by integrating the
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Genome Sequence
      Archive (GSA) datasets. Compared to adjacent normal tissues, we observed that
      CTHRC1 was highly overexpressed in tumor sample of multiple cancers. It was
      revealed that CTHRC1 overexpression was positively correlated with the T stage in
      gastric cancer but not lymph nodes metastasis from TCGA dataset. In addition,
      CTHRC1 expression may induce tumor associated macrophage infiltration though
      GRN/TNFRSF1A and AnxA1/FPR1 pathways and also tumor angiogenesis in gastric
      cancer. In this context, our results indicate that CTHRC1 plays a pivotal role in
      regulating the angiogenesis and macrophage infiltration in tumor
      microenvironment, and also can predict poor prognosis in gastric cancer,
      suggesting that CTHRC1 might be a promising novel immunotherapy and angiogenesis 
      target for gastric cancer.

LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.913398 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Ficolin (FCN) family proteins are part of the innate immune system,
      play a role as recognition molecules in the complement system, and are associated
      with tumor development. The mechanism of its role in immunotherapy of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. Methods: In this study, we used the
      TCGA database, HPA database, Gene Expression Profile Interaction Analysis
      (GEPIA), Kaplan-Meier plotter, TCGAportal, cBioPortal, GeneMANIA, TIMER, and
      TISIDB to analyze Ficolin family proteins (FCN1, FCN2 and FCN3, FCNs) in patients
      with hepatocellular carcinoma for differential expression, prognostic value,
      genetic alterations, functional enrichment, and immune factor correlation
      analysis. Results: The expression levels of FCN1/2/3 were significantly reduced
      in patients with HCC. Among them, FCN3 showed significant correlation with
      Overall Survival (OS), Progressive Free Survival (PFS) and Relapse Free Survival 
      (RFS) in HCC. FCN1 and FCN3 may be potential prognostic markers for survival in
      patients with HCC. In addition, the functions of differentially expressed FCNs
      were mainly related to complement activation, immune response, apoptotic cell
      clearance and phagocytosis. FCNs were found to be significantly correlated with
      multiple immune cells and immune factors. Expression of FCN1 and FCN3 differed
      significantly in the immune and stromal cell component scores of HCC. analysis of
      the tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) of FCNs with
      pan-cancer showed that FCN3 was significantly correlated with both. Conclusions: 
      Our study provides new insights into the link between the FCN family and
      immunotherapy for HCC, and FCN3 may serve as a prognostic biomarker for HCC.

TI  - Recognition of Glycometabolism-Associated lncRNAs as Prognosis Markers for
      Bladder Cancer by an Innovative Prediction Model.
PG  - 918705
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.918705 [doi]
AB  - The alteration of glycometabolism is a characteristic of cancer cells. Long
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been documented to occupy a considerable position 
      in glycometabolism regulation. This research aims to construct an effective
      prediction model for the prognosis of bladder cancer (BC) based on
      glycometabolism-associated lncRNAs (glyco-lncRNAs). Pearson correlation analysis 
      was applied to get glyco-lncRNAs, and then, univariate cox regression analysis
      was employed to further filtrate survival time-associated glyco-lncRNAs.
      Multivariate cox regression analysis was utilized to construct the prediction
      model to divide bladder cancer (BC) patients into high- and low-risk groups. The 
      overall survival (OS) rates of these two groups were analyzed using the
      Kaplan-Meier method. Next, gene set enrichment analysis and Cibersortx were used 
      to explore the enrichment and the difference in immune cell infiltration,
      respectively. pRRophetic algorithm was applied to explore the relation between
      chemotherapy sensitivity and the prediction model. Furthermore, reverse
      transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction was adopted to detect the
      lncRNAs constituting the prediction signature in tissues and urine exosomal
      samples of BC patients. A powerful model including 6 glyco-lncRNAs was proposed, 
      capable of suggesting a risk score for each BC patient to predict prognosis.
      Patients with high-risk scores demonstrated a shorter survival time both in the
      training cohort and testing cohort, and the risk score could predict the
      prognosis without depending on the traditional clinical traits. The area under
      the receiver operating characteristic curve of the risk score was higher than
      that of other clinical traits (0.755 > 0.640, 0.485, 0.644, or 0.568). The high- 
      and low-risk groups demonstrated very distinct immune cells infiltration
      conditions and gene set enriched terms. Besides, the high-risk group was more
      sensitive to cisplatin, docetaxel, and sunitinib. The expression of lncRNA
      AL354919.2 featured with an increase in low-grade patients and a decrease in T3-4
      and Stage III-IV patients. Based on the experiment results, lncRNA AL355353.1,
      AC011468.1, and AL354919.2 were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues. This 
      research furnishes a novel reference for predicting the prognosis of BC patients,
      assisting clinicians with help in the choice of treatment.

AB  - Women and children enrolled in federally funded home visitation services are at
      an increased risk for unhealthy diet and physical activity patterns. Home
      visitors have a privileged relationship with their clients and hold a unique
      perspective of the multilevel influences surrounding these behaviors. This study 
      explored the question: "What are home visitors' perspectives and experiences with
      their families' diet and physical activity behaviors?" Home visitors enrolled in 
      a larger trial were invited to participate in focus group sessions (n=13). Topics
      covered their clients' constraints and capacity building opportunities for
      healthful diet and activity practices. Reflexive thematic analysis was used to
      analyze the data. The home visitors discussed key influences on diet and
      activity, and three overarching themes were identified: (a) acute periods of
      crises and mental health issues; (b) the role of the mother within the family;
      and (c) support and barriers within mothers' broader social network. The themes
      identified in this study highlight the complex, multidimensional influences on
      the dietary and physical activity patterns of these families, and pinpoint key
      areas of opportunity for intervention.

TI  - Investigating the molecular mechanisms of Tamoxifen on the EMT pathway among
      patients with breast cancer.
PG  - 835-844
LID - 10.25122/jml-2022-0085 [doi]
AB  - Tamoxifen is one of the most used drugs for breast cancer. This study aimed to
      investigate the effect of the Tamoxifen mechanism on the epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) pathway among breast cancer patients due to its resistance to
      breast cancer cells. We selected the appropriate datasets from the GEO database
      using continuous and integrated bioinformatics analysis. We examined the
      signaling pathways, gene ontology, and protein association of genes after
      classifying the gene expression profile. Finally, we confirmed the candidate
      genes using the GEPIA database. Two groups were defined for gene expression
      profiles. The first group in which the expression profile of genes increased
      after Tamoxifen was evaluated using the expression profile of genes that
      decreased in the EMT pathway. The second group was the opposite of the first
      group. 253 genes in the first group and 302 genes in the second group were
      shared. The genes in the first group were involved in various pathways of cell
      death, focal adhesion, and cellular aging. The second group was more involved in 
      different phases of the cell cycle. Finally, MYLK, SOCS3, and STAT5B proteins
      from the first group and BIRC5, PLK1, and RAPGAP1 proteins from the second group 
      were selected as candidate proteins in connection with the effect of Tamoxifen on
      the EMT pathway. We evaluated Tamoxifen's effect on the EMT pathway more
      accurately. However, for a closer look at Tamoxifen, more studies need to be done
      on target genes and proteins to clarify their role.

      adult mice.
PG  - 819-827
LID - 10.25122/jml-2021-0269 [doi]
AB  - One of the most complex clinical challenges facing medical practice is
      sepsis-induced lung dysfunction resulting from polymicrobial sepsis. Although
      many therapeutic approaches have been used in such clinical challenges, there is 
      still further need for a new effective therapeutic approach. The objective of
      this study was to investigate if Montelukast could protect the lungs during
      polymicrobial sepsis by regulating inflammatory markers and the oxidative stress 
      pathways. Twenty-four mature male Swiss-albino mice aged 8-12 weeks, with a
      weight of 20-30 g, were randomized into 4 equal groups (n=6), sham (laparotomy
      without cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)), CLP (laparotomy with CLP), vehicle 1 
      (equivalent volume of DMSO 1 hour prior to CLP), Montelukast (10 mg/kg IP 1 hour 
      prior to CLP). Lung tissue pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-17,
      LTB-4 12(S) HETE, and oxidative stress were assessed using ELISA. The levels of
      F2 isoprostane were considerably greater in the sepsis group (p<0.05) as compared
      to the sham group, while Montelukast was significantly lower (p<0.05) in these
      inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress as compared to the sepsis group.
      Histologically, the lung tissue damage was significant (p<0.05) in all mice in
      the sepsis group, while Montelukast significantly reduced lung tissue injury
      (p<0.05). The current findings indicated that Montelukast could attenuate lung
      dysfunction during CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis in male mice through their
      modulating effects on pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress downstream signalling
      pathways and subsequently decrease lung tissue cytokine concentrations (IL-1beta,
      IL-6, IL-17, LTB-4, and 12(S)HETE).

AB  - This study investigated the alteration of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and 
      interleukin-19 (IL-19) at different clinical disease stages, lymph node
      metastasis, and ductal carcinoma in women with breast cancer. Serum samples were 
      collected from 90 individuals with an age range of 25-61 years. These individuals
      were divided into a control group (healthy people), consisting of 31 individuals,
      and a breast cancer patients (BCP) group, consisting of 59 individuals. The
      pathological data (tumour stage, lymph node metastasis, and ductal carcinoma) was
      obtained from the medical record of patients and confirmed by experienced
      histopathology. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs) technology was used to
      measure the serum concentrations of IL-19 and TNF-alpha. The results showed
      significant differences (P</=0.002) in the mean of BMI, interleukin-19, and
      TNF-alpha in BCP compared to controls, while the age factor did not play an
      important role. The stages of breast cancer caused clear differences in the
      levels of TNF-alpha and IL-19. According to the findings, BCPs had a greater
      level of TNF-alpha in lymph node metastases than healthy persons. The
      concentration of serum IL-19 in BCP with lymph node metastasis was significantly 
      different in non-lymph node metastasis patients and healthy people. Additionally,
      BCP with ductal carcinoma showed significant differences in the mean levels of
      IL-19 and TNF-alpha in comparison with healthy people.

AB  - Energy and plastic potential dysfunction of erythrocytes and lymphocytes among
      people with inflammatory breast cancer, infiltrative stomach cancer, and
      infiltrative colon cancer is characterized by a more aggressive clinical course
      and poor prognosis. We explored the features of energy metabolism and phosphorus 
      metabolism disorders in the erythrocytes and lymphocytes of patients with
      inflammatory breast cancer, infiltrative stomach cancer, and infiltrative colon
      cancer as a predicting factor in the course of the disease. 49 people were
      examined; the 1(st) group had infiltrative stomach cancer (n=17); the 2(nd) group
      had infiltrative colon cancer (n=11); the 3(rd) group had inflammatory breast
      cancer (n=21). Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was 1.8 times reduced 
      (p</=0.005), and the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in
      erythrocytes of patients with cancer at the main localization increased 2.5
      times, compared with normal. Inflammatory breast cancer patients had a
      statistically significant decrease (p<0.005) in erythrocytes adenosine
      triphosphate content by an average of 56.5% compared with the normal ratio, and
      in cases of patients with gastric and colorectal cancer, a decrease of 67%.
      Excessive use of phosphorus for energy metabolism and adenosine triphosphate
      production destroys the balance of energetic and plastic potentials of
      erythrocytes and lymphocytes in inflammatory breast cancer, infiltrative stomach,
      and infiltrative colorectal cancers patients.

AB  - Paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia is a paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) 
      that can be the first clinical manifestation of underlying cancer. It is usually 
      associated with onco-neuronal antibodies and has no other specific paraclinical
      feature. After the surgical and oncologic treatment of the primary cancer, the
      remaining neurological symptoms have limited therapeutic options. We describe a
      case of severe ataxia as the primary manifestation of ovarian cancer, with a
      significant clinical and paraclinical improvement of the neurological symptoms
      after 20 sessions of rTMS intervention.

AB  - Background: Repeat craniotomy in patients with primary and metastatic brain
      tumors carries significant morbidity and can delay adjuvant treatments. Repeat
      laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for recurrent disease has been
      described and could benefit patients with limited cytoreductive options. We aim
      to describe the indications, safety, and efficacy of repeat LITT for recurrent
      primary and metastatic intracranial tumors. Methods: Patients undergoing repeat
      ablations for the same lesion were included in the study. We retrospectively
      analyzed 13 patients treated with 29 total LITT ablations. Results: Eleven
      patients were treated for glioblastoma (GBM), while two had brain metastases.
      Eleven patients had LITT performed only 2 times, while three patients underwent
      three total iterations of LITT for disease recurrence. Median length of stay
      after the 1(st) ablation was 2 days, while the median length of stay after the
      2(nd) ablation was 1 day. The median time to resuming adjuvant treatments after
      the 1(st) LITT was 11 days. The median time to resuming adjuvant treatments after
      the 2(nd) LITT was 28 days. Four patients after the 1(st) and 2(nd) LITT
      sustained deficits persisting through 30-day follow-up. The median
      progression-free survival among the GBM patients from the first ablation was 6.0 
      months, 3.2 months from the 2(nd) ablation, and 2.1 months from the 3(rd)
      ablation. Conclusion: Recurrent tumors, especially GBM, can be safely treated
      using repeat LITT when surgery cannot be effectively performed. Our results
      indicate that patients tolerate the procedure well and have a meaningful survival
      given the salvage nature of the procedure.

TI  - Outcomes and efficiency of managing patients admitted for surgery for spinal
      metastases.
PG  - 312
LID - 10.25259/SNI_371_2022 [doi]
AB  - Background: This study evaluated the current pathways for dealing with patients
      admitted for surgery to address spinal metastases. Methods: In this retrospective
      analysis (2016-2021), the following variables were studied admission,
      demographics, length of stay, critical care admission, hospital costs, primary
      cancer, and average survival. Results: There were 306 patients admitted from 2016
      to 2021; 66 were planned admissions, 203 were emergency admissions, and 37 were
      day case admission. Patients averaged 65.4 years old. About 75% (203) were
      emergently admitted, while 25% (66) had planned elective admissions. Their
      respective lengths of stay were 16.5 versus 5.74 days. Interestingly, nearly half
      of the emergency admissions (46.3%) did not have surgery during that admission.
      The most common level for metastatic disease was the thoracic spine in both
      groups (53% in the elective vs. 62% emergency groups). The most common primary
      lesions included lung, breast, and prostate in both groups. The average survival 
      in the emergency admission group was 9.1 months and the planned admission group
      was 13.07 months. Notably, the costs of emergent care were much higher than
      planned admissions. Conclusion: The pathway for spinal metastases is unique in
      that though there is a pathway for late-stage disease, there is not one for early
      disease. As a result, the majority of patients admitted for surgery for spinal
      metastases come in as an emergency rather than as a planned admission. Yet, close
      to half do not end up having surgery during that emergency admission to the
      spinal center. The cost of emergency care is significantly higher versus planned 
      elective care for spinal metastatic disease. A service transformation is
      suggested to combat these problems with a pathway for managing all spinal
      metastases, rather than just metastatic spinal cord compression.

      Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
PG  - 872310
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.872310 [doi]
AB  - Background: Aging is a phenomenon universally involving all organisms,
      genetically determined, and epigenetically influenced by the environment.
      Numerous observational studies have shown the positive impact of
      non-pharmacological approaches started in younger age on chronic conditions
      affecting the elderly health and survival. This meta-analysis aimed to
      investigate the effect of beta-carotene on the total and cause-specific mortality
      as reported by randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched Medline,
      Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL Cochrane from inception to September 2021.
      Studies were eligible if enrolled adults with any health condition, compared
      beta-carotene supplements at any dose with placebo or no intervention, provided
      information on deaths from any cause, and were RCTs, in English. The risk of bias
      was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the GRADE. Risk ratios and
      their 95% confidence intervals were used and a P-value less than 0.05 was
      considered statistically significant. Results: Among 3,942 articles searched, 44 
      articles on 31 RCTs, which included 216,734 total subjects, 108,622 in
      beta-carotene supplement groups, and 108,112 in the placebo or no-intervention
      groups, were involved in the final analyses. In a random-effects meta-analysis of
      all 31 trials, beta-carotene supplements were found to have no preventive effect 
      on mortality (risk ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.05, I (2) = 42%).
      Further, the analysis showed no preventive effect on cancer, cardiovascular,
      cerebrovascular, and other mortality causes. Instead, beta-carotene
      supplementation significantly increased the risk of lung cancer mortality (RR
      1.14, 95% CI 1.02, 1.27, I (2) = 3%) but decreased the risk of human
      immunodeficiency virus-related mortality (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33, 0.92, I (2) = 0).
      Conclusion: More studies should be performed to better define the role of
      beta-carotene on survival, to confirm or deny our results. Therefore, the
      possible beneficial or harmful effects of the beta-carotene supplementation on
      mortality must not be overstated. Systematic Review Registration:

PG  - 890417
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2022.890417 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had an enormous impact on healthcare
      delivery globally. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in Turkey to
      evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare services in Turkey. A 35-item
      anonymized online survey was completed by HCPs (medical doctors, MD) who
      continued their clinical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey,
      regardless of their specialties or degrees. Overall, 209 HCPs participated in the
      study. Forty-two percent of the participants stated that their current workload
      intensity has been increased compared with the pre-pandemic era. More than half
      of the participants (54.6%) were using telemedicine services during their
      clinical practice, however, the effectiveness of telemedicine for first-time
      patients and follow-up patients was rated as low. The majority of participants
      (59.3%) reported that during the peak period of the pandemic, they encountered
      only a small variety of cases, other than COVID-19. Fifty-two percent of the
      participants agreed that they occasionally had patients who received misdiagnosis
      in the first admission due to the suspicion of a possible COVID-19 infection
      predominating the diagnostic process (eg., not excluding COVID-19 even though the
      PCR test is negative). For the distribution of possible late-diagnosed diseases, 
      25.8% of HCPs selected chest diseases, followed by infectious diseases, heart
      diseases, and cancer. In general, participants agreed that there was an increase 
      in the negligence in the follow-up of various diseases and/or complication rates 
      due to COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty percent of the HCPs agreed that HCPs are being
      much more rigorous to diagnose/treating COVID-19 than other important diseases.
      Fifty-seven percent of the participants stated that the diagnosis and follow-up
      of chronic diseases are affected, while 57.9% of the HCPs stated that some
      diseases that show similar signs and symptoms as COVID-19 are not diagnosed
      correctly during COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study emphasize that
      COVID-19 pandemic has significantly caused delayed diagnoses and interruption in 
      the management of chronic diseases, and also increased the risk of missing out
      the diagnosis of non-COVID-19 diseases. The study genuinely aims to yield the
      floor to a permanent improvement in post-pandemic clinical management and it also
      shows the need for a focused approach in distinct areas of medical care.
      Policymaking is required to drive changes to better support HCPs in Turkey.

AB  - Background: Clinicians have limited time during patient encounters which can
      result in patients' concerns not being addressed. This study's objective was to
      test whether an electronic patient-reported outcome quality of life tool (PROQOL)
      in which patients identify their primary concern during clinic visits improves
      cancer patient quality of life (QOL). Patients and methods: This single center
      non-blinded prospective clinical trial randomized patients (2:1) to PROQOL versus
      usual care (UC). Two patient cohorts were enrolled: those with hematologic
      malignancies (multiple myeloma [MM] or light chain amyloidosis [AL]) and solid
      tumors (head and neck [H/N] or gynecologic [GYN] malignancies). Primary endpoint 
      was patient-reported QOL at 12 months measured by a single-item Linear Analog
      Self-Assessment. Value to patients and impact on clinician workflow was measured 
      using a "was it worth it" survey. The study was powered to detect a 0.5 standard 
      deviation difference between groups. Results: Overall 383 patients were enrolled,
      171 with MM, 62 AL, 113 GYN, and 37 H/N between July 2016 and April 2018, with
      12-month follow-up. There were 171 (44.6%) male patients and median age was 62
      years (range 31-87). The most often selected concern was physical health (30.9%),
      and second was cancer diagnosis and treatment (29.1%). Mean QOL was 7.12 for
      PROQOL and 6.98 for UC (0-10 scale) at 12 months, with no between-group
      difference overall (p = 0.56) or within hematologic or solid tumor cohorts,
      respectively. Among patients, 74% thought the PROQOL tool was worthwhile, 86%
      would choose PROQOL again, and 81% would recommend it to others. Among
      clinicians, 95% responded that PROQOL was worthwhile and did not think that
      PROQOL negatively impacted their workflow. Conclusions: Although we did not
      demonstrate a QOL difference between PROQOL and UC groups; the PROQOL tool held
      considerable value in identifying patients' main concerns over time and was
      worthwhile for patients and clinicians.

AB  - Panax ginseng C.A. Mey. has a history of more than 4000 years and is widely used 
      in Asian countries. Modern pharmacological studies have proved that ginsenosides 
      and their compounds have a variety of significant biological activities on
      specific diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, certain types of cancer,
      gastrointestinal disease, and metabolic diseases, in which most of the interest
      has focused on ginsenoside Rd. The evidentiary basis showed that ginsenoside Rd
      ameliorates ischemic stroke, nerve injury, cancer, and other diseases involved in
      apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and autophagy.
      In this review, we summarized available reports on the molecular biological
      mechanisms of ginsenoside Rd in neurological diseases, cancer, metabolic
      diseases, and other diseases. We also discussed the main biotransformation
      pathways of ginsenoside Rd obtained by fermentation.

LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.847534 [doi]
AB  - Adenium obesum commonly known as "desert rose" belongs to the family Apopcynaceae
      and has previously been reported for its anti-influenza, antimicrobial, and
      cytotoxic efficacies and well-known for their ethno-medicinal applications. In
      the present study, ethanolic extracts of A. obesum (AOE) were analyzed by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the important phytochemical 
      compounds. The GC-MS analysis of AOE detected the presence of 26 phytochemical
      compounds. This plant is traditionally used for the treatment of various
      diseases. In this report, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer
      activities of ethanolic leaf extract from A. obesum (AOE) were studied. The
      antioxidant potential of ethanolic extract of AOE was examined by different
      antioxidant assays, such as antioxidant capacity by the DPPH, ABTS, superoxide,
      hydroxyl radical scavenging, and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays. The
      antioxidant activities of various reaction mixtures of AOE were compared with a
      reference or standard antioxidant (ascorbic acid). In addition, we also evaluated
      the anticancer activity of AOE, and it was observed that AOE was found to be
      cytotoxic against A549 lung cancer cells. It was found that AOE inhibited the
      viability of A549 lung cancer cells by inducing nuclear condensation and
      fragmentation. Furthermore, ethanolic AOE demonstrated the anti-inflammatory
      potential of AOE in murine alveolar macrophages (J774A.1) as an in vitro model
      system. AOE showed its potential in reducing the levels of inflammatory mediators
      including the proinflammatory cytokines and TNF-alpha. The results obtained in
      the present investigation established the antioxidant, anticancer, and
      anti-inflammatory potency of AOE, which may account for subsequent studies in the
      formulation of herbal-based medicine.

TI  - Penta-O-Galloyl-beta-D-Glucose in Pistacia integerrima Targets AMPK-ULK1 and
      ERK/STAT3 Signaling Axes to Induce ROS-Independent Autophagic Cell Death in Human
      Lung Cancer Cells.
PG  - 889335
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.889335 [doi]
AB  - Natural molecules have promising perspectives as adjuvants to chemotherapies
      against cancer. Pistacia chinensis subsp. Integerrima (hereafter, Pistacia
      integerrima) traditionally known for medicinal values in respiratory disorders
      was tested for anti-lung cancer properties. The extract prepared from Pistacia
      integerrima (PI) selectively impaired the viability of lung cancer cells, A549
      and NCI-H460, compared to non-cancer cells. At non-lethal concentrations, PI
      mitigated colony-forming, spheroid formations and metastatic properties of lung
      cancer cells. As a step toward identifying the phytomolecule that is imparting
      the anti-lung cancer properties in PI, we subjected the extract to extensive
      characterization through UPLC/QToF-MS and further validated the findings with
      UHPLC. The gallotannin, penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (PGG), among others, was
      identified through UPLC/QToF-MS. PGG exhibits potential chemopreventive effects
      against various cancer types. However, a defined mechanism of action of PGG in
      restricting lung cancer progression is still unexplored. Bioactivity-guided
      column fractionations enabled the determination of PGG as the major phytochemical
      that governed PI-mediated AMPK-ULK1-dependent autophagy and apoptosis, albeit
      independent of intracellular ROS activation. Interestingly, the autophagy flux
      when inhibited restored the cell viability even in the presence of PI. The study 
      further delineated that PI and PGG activated ERK and inhibited STAT3 to trigger
      apoptosis through caspase-3 and PARP 1 pathways. Collectively, the finding
      demonstrates that plant extract, PGG, in the PI extract effectively combats lung 
      cancer progression through autophagic cell death by altering ERK/AMPK-ULK1/STAT3 
      signaling axes. The study proposes PGG as a potential AMPK activator and STAT3
      inhibitor that can be exploited further in developing adjuvant chemotherapeutics 
      against lung cancer.

TI  - Urinary Aromatic Amino Acid Metabolites Associated With Postoperative Emergence
      Agitation in Paediatric Patients After General Anaesthesia: Urine Metabolomics
      Study.
PG  - 932776
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.932776 [doi]
AB  - Background: Emergence agitation (EA) is very common in paediatric patients during
      recovery from general anaesthesia, but underlying mechanisms remain unknown. This
      prospective study was designed to profile preoperative urine metabolites and
      identify potential biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of EA. Methods: A
      total of 224 patients were screened for recruitment; of those, preoperative
      morning urine samples from 33 paediatric patients with EA and 33 non-EA gender-
      and age-matched patients after being given sevoflurane general anaesthesia were
      analysed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a Q
      Exactive Plus mass spectrometer. Univariate analysis and orthogonal projection to
      latent structures squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to analyse
      these metabolites. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
      regression was used to identify predictive variables. The predictive model was
      evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and then
      further assessed with 10-fold cross-validation. Results: Seventy-seven patients
      completed the study, of which 33 (42.9%) patients developed EA. EA and non-EA
      patients had many differences in preoperative urine metabolic profiling. Sixteen 
      metabolites including nine aromatic amino acid metabolites, acylcarnitines,
      pyridoxamine, porphobilinogen, 7-methylxanthine, and 5'-methylthioadenosine were 
      found associated with an increased risk of EA, and they all exhibited higher
      levels in the EA group than in the non-EA group. The main metabolic pathways
      involved in these metabolic changes included phenylalanine, tyrosine and
      tryptophan metabolisms. Among these potential biomarkers, L-tyrosine had the best
      predictive value with an odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) of 5.27 (2.20-12.63) and the
      AUC value of 0.81 (0.70-0.91) and was robust with internal 10-fold
      cross-validation. Conclusion: Urinary aromatic amino acid metabolites are closely
      associated with EA in paediatric patients, and further validation with larger
      cohorts and mechanistic studies is needed. Clinical Trial Registration:
      clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT04807998.

TI  - Nivolumab Versus Sorafenib as First-Line Therapy for Advanced Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.
PG  - 906956
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.906956 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Nivolumab improves overall survival (OS) and is associated with fewer 
      adverse events than sorafenib for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (aHCC). However, the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab compared with
      sorafenib treatment for aHCC remains unclear. This study evaluated the
      cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and sorafenib in the treatment of aHCC. Materials
      and methods: A partitioned survival model that included three mutually exclusive 
      health states was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and
      sorafenib for treating aHCC. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of the
      patients in the model were obtained from the CheckMate 459. We performed
      deterministic one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to
      evaluate the robustness of the model. Subgroup analyses were also performed.
      Costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), incremental net health benefits (INHB), and
      incremental net monetary benefits (INMB) were measured. Results: The base case
      analysis showed that compared with sorafenib, treatment with nivolumab was
      associated with an increment of 0.50 (2.45 vs. 1.95) life-years and an increment 
      of 0.32 (1.59 vs. 1.27) QALYs, as well as a $69,762 increase in cost per patient.
      The ICER was $220,864/QALY. The INHB and INMB were -0.15 QALYs and -$22,362 at a 
      willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000/QALY, respectively. The
      probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability of nivolumab
      being cost-effective was only 10.38% at a WTP threshold of $150,000/QALY. The
      model was most sensitive to the costs of sorafenib and nivolumab according to the
      one-way sensitivity analysis. When the price of sorafenib exceeded $0.93/mg or
      nivolumab was less than $24.23/mg, nivolumab was more cost-effective. The
      subgroup analysis illustrated that the probability of cost-effectiveness was >50%
      in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Stage B subgroups for nivolumab at a WTP
      threshold of $150,000/QALY. This study also showed that the probability of
      cost-effectiveness was <50% in most subgroups. Conclusion: Nivolumab was not
      cost-effective, although it was associated with better clinical benefit and a
      favorable safety profile for the treatment of aHCC compared with sorafenib from
      the third-party payer perspective in the United States. If the price of nivolumab
      is substantially reduced, favorable cost-effectiveness can be achieved among
      patients with aHCC.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of Codonopsis
      pilosula (Franch.) Nannf. (Codonopsis Radix, CR) and reveal the mechanism of its 
      effects on suppressing Gastric Precancerous Lesions. Methods: First, we
      established the GPL rat model which was induced by
      N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, a disordered diet, and 40% ethanol. The
      CR's anti-Gastric Precancerous Lesions effect was comprehensively evaluated by
      body weight, pathological section, and serum biochemical indexes. Then,
      quantitative proteomics and metabolomics were conducted to unveil the disturbed
      protein-network and pharmacodynamic mechanism. Furthermore, serum pharmacology
      was employed to confirm that CR's anti-gastritis and anti-cancer phenotype in
      cell models. Results: In animal models, CR had been shown to control inflammation
      and ameliorate Gastric Precancerous Lesions. Considering the combination of
      proteomics and metabolomics, we found that CR could significantly reverse the
      biological pathways related to energy metabolism which were disturbed by the
      Gastric Precancerous Lesions model. Furthermore, the results of serum
      pharmacology indicated that the Codonopsis Radix containing serum could
      ameliorate gastritis injury and selectively inhibit the proliferation of gastric 
      cancer cells rather than normal cells, which was closely related to ATP
      production in the above mentioned cells. Conclusion: In summary, CR exerted
      anti-Gastric Precancerous Lesions effects by ameliorating gastritis injury and
      selectively inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells rather than
      normal cells. Proteomics and metabolomics unveiled that its efficacy was closely 
      related to its regulation of the energy-metabolism pathway. This research not
      only provided new ideas for exploring the mechanism of complex systems such as
      Chinese herbals but also benefited the treatment strategy of Gastric Precancerous
      Lesions via regulating energy metabolism.

AB  - Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) originated from ancient retroviral
      infections of germline cells millions of years ago and have evolved as part of
      the host genome. HERVs not only retain the capacity as retroelements but also
      regulate host genes. The expansion of HERVs involves transcription by RNA
      polymerase II, reverse transcription, and re-integration into the host genome.
      Fast progress in deep sequencing and functional analysis has revealed the
      importance of domesticated copies of HERVs, including their regulatory sequences,
      transcripts, and proteins in normal cells. However, evidence also suggests the
      involvement of HERVs in the development and progression of many types of cancer. 
      Here we summarize the current state of knowledge about the expression of HERVs,
      transcriptional regulation of host genes by HERVs, and the functions of HERVs in 
      reverse transcription and gene editing with their reverse transcriptase.

TI  - The role of neurologists in the era of cancer immunotherapy: Focus on CAR T-cell 
      therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
PG  - 936141
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.936141 [doi]
AB  - Cancer immunotherapy represents a novel anticancer strategy that acts directly on
      the immune system, promoting its activation toward cancer cells to enhance its
      natural ability to fight cancer. Among various treatments currently used or
      investigated, chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T-cell therapy and immune
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have consistently proven their efficacy. These
      innovations are progressively improving the standard of care in cancer treatment,
      yet they are hampered by novel neurological adverse events, attributing to
      neurologists a key role in the multidisciplinary oncological team. Indeed,
      neurotoxicity may develop in up to 77% of patients who received CAR T-cell
      therapy and usually presents with encephalopathy characterized by a predominant
      frontal lobe dysfunction. This neurotoxicity is related to cytokine release
      syndrome, a systemic hyperinflammatory condition triggered by CAR T-cells. On the
      other hand, following treatment with ICIs, unrestrained T-cells may lead to
      central and peripheral neurological disorders by antigen-directed autoimmunity.
      Notably, biological and clinical similarities have been underlined between
      neurotoxicity related to CAR T-cell therapy and neurological manifestations of
      cytokine storms (e.g. COVID-19-related encephalopathy), as well as between a
      subgroup of ICI-related neurological adverse events and paraneoplastic
      neurological syndromes. Therefore, these cancer immunotherapy-related
      neurological syndromes may provide an unprecedented, perhaps transitory,
      opportunity to shed light on the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of a wide
      spectrum of neurological syndromes and to push forward our knowledge in
      neuroimmunology.

TI  - Prognosis value of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1beta in serum of patients with lung
      cancer: A fresh look at interleukins as a biomarker.

AB  - Interleukins are assumed to be closely related to the occurrence and development 
      of human malignant tumors, while a few of them were commonly used as diagnostic
      markers in clinical cancer, including lung cancer. This study aimed to explore
      the value of serum interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
      interleukin-8 (IL-8) combined with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as biomarker
      panel for the diagnosis and metastasis prediction of lung cancer. IL-1beta, IL-6,
      IL-8, and CEA in serum were determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay
      (ECLIA) and flow cytometry, and the diagnostic value of each marker was analyzed 
      using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic fitting
      regression. We found that the levels of serum IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 showed no 
      significant difference among squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small
      cell carcinoma, while they were significantly higher in the lung cancer group or 
      benign group than those in the healthy group. The levels of IL-8 and CEA were
      positively correlated with clinical stages respectively. Importantly, the panel
      of CEA + IL-6 + IL-8 has the highest efficacy for the diagnosis of lung cancer
      (AUC = 0.883) among all the detected panels, while the panel of IL-8 + CEA showed
      the most promising predictive value for the lymph node metastasis (AUC = 0.686)
      and distant metastasis of lung cancer (AUC = 0.793). In conclusion, IL-6 and IL-8
      could be used as promising molecular biomarkers to diagnose and predict the
      metastasis of lung cancer independent of pathological types, improving the
      specificity and sensitivity of diagnosis for lung cancer when they were combined 
      with CEA.

TI  - Quality of the Systematic Reviews in Cochrane Gynecological Cancer Group and
      Their Understudied RCTs.
PG  - 346-351

AB  - Purpose: Gynecological cancers are common neoplasms in clinical settings with a
      high impact on the economy of communities. The medical literature is an essential
      resource to guide clinical decision-making, and misconduct in researches
      undermines the credibility and integrity of research in general. We aimed to
      evaluate the quality of Cochrane gynecological cancers reviews and their
      understudies RCTS among the different biases dimensions. Methods: This
      cross-sectional analytical study was performed on 118 systematic reviews
      published by the Cochrane gynecological cancers Group up to June 2021. The risk
      of bias was assessed in each Cochrane survey using the Joanna Bridges Institute
      (JBI) critical assessment tool consisting of 11 questions. The JBI checklist for 
      systematic reviews and research syntheses is available at
      https://jbi.global/critical-appraisal-tools. After a systematic critical
      evaluation of the reviews and meta-analysis, we extracted a different bias from
      all of their understudied RCTs examined in these systematic reviews, which were
      evaluated by systematic review authors using a standard bias risk tool developed 
      by the Cochrane Group. Results: Cochrane gynecological cancers reviews had high
      quality based on appraise results using the JBI appraisal checklist. In addition,
      all of the included studies used PRISMA standards for reporting their results.
      However, in their understudied RCTs, the most prevalent risk of bias was unclear 
      selection bias (allocation concealment) and performance bias (blinding of
      participants and personnel). Also, the highest risk of bias was blinding
      participants and personnel (performance bias) and incomplete outcome data
      (attrition bias). Our results showed that the lowest risk of bias was incomplete 
      outcome data (attrition bias) and random sequence generation (selection bias).
      Conclusion: Although most Cochrane gynecological cancers reviews had high
      quality, unclear performance bias was the highest in their understudied RCTs,
      indicating structural deficiencies. Supplementary Information: The online version

AB  - Introduction: Sentinel lymph node mapping is emerging as an accurate technique to
      assess the lymph nodal status while reducing surgical and postoperative
      morbidity. Present study looks into the detection rates and location of sentinel 
      nodes during Sentinel node mapping when Indocyanine green dye was used as a
      tracer. Methods: This is a single institutional study with details retrieved from
      a prospectively maintained database. All patients who underwent sentinel node
      mapping using ICG dye for atypical hyperplasia, endometrial and cervical cancers 
      from February 2015 to April 2020 were included. Location of the sentinel node was
      taken from the graphical record maintained during surgery. The data obtained are 
      expressed as number and percentage and/or mean and standard deviation for
      continuous variables. Chi-square test was performed to compare categorical
      variables. Results: Two hundred and seventy-nine patients underwent sentinel node
      mapping with ICG dye during this period. Mapping was successful in 270 patients
      (96.8%) with 85% having successful bilateral mapping. Obturator was the most
      common location (52%) followed by external iliac (34%). There was no significant 
      difference in detection among patients with BMI less than 30 or more than 30. The
      detection rate across various histologies of endometrial cancer was also similar.
      Conclusion: Sentinel node mapping using ICG dye has got excellent overall and
      bilateral detection rates making it a valuable tool. Obturator was found to be
      the most common location for the sentinel node. Mapping using ICG dye yield good 
      detection rates in all histologies of endometrial cancer and in patients with
      high BMI.

AB  - Objective: The study was undertaken for comparing the colposcopy directed punch
      versus loop excision biopsy technique in order to get the most precised sample
      for study as well as comparing the complications associated with them. Materials 
      and Methods: The prospective clinical study was conducted on 50 women of age
      group 20-80 years. Women who were found to have a Reid colposcopic index of high 
      grade disease, low grade disease or invasive disease recognized as the patients
      needed biopsy. They were randomly divided into either the punch biopsy forceps
      group (PB group) or the round loop electrode group (LE group). Result: The
      quality of tissue of the LE group was found significantly better than the tissue 
      quality of PB group based on the size, site and tissue damaged measures. Both the
      groups were found to have the same cytology report as well as colposcopic
      diagnosis and histology reports. Mild degree of bleeding has been reported as a
      frequent complication in LEEP and punch biopsy. The VAS pain score associated in 
      each procedure was found to be 2.4 and 2.8, respectively, in both groups with no 
      significant difference. Conclusion: The present study has concluded that the
      quality of tissue from the LEEP biopsy electrode was better than the punch biopsy
      forceps with no difference in the pain score, and it could be suggested that use 
      of the round loop electrode in CDB provides good quality tissue to evaluate the
      histology.

TI  - Uterine Sarcoma: Retrospective Study From A Single institute.
PG  - 306-312
LID - 10.1007/s13224-021-01612-9 [doi]
AB  - Abstract: Uterine sarcomas are heterogeneous group of tumours comprising 1% of
      gynaecological malignancies. There is lack of concences on optimal treatment of
      uterine sarcomas. This is because of lack of randomised controlled trials due to 
      rarity of these tumours. Surgical management without spill remains the standard
      primary treatment. Most of the times uterine sarcomas are diagnosed
      postoperatively from histopathology report of either myomectomy or hysterectomy. 
      This retrospective study analysed the clinico pathological characteristics,
      prognostic factors, treatment details and survival outcome of different types of 
      uterine sarcomas. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective analysis of 59
      patients of uterine sarcomas. All patients underwent surgery. Adjuvant
      chemotherapy or radiation treatment were given according to histopathological
      report and FIGO stage. Patients were followed up every three months for first two
      years and then every six months. Disease free survival (DFS) and Overall survival
      (OS) were calculated. Statistical analysis: The data were summarized using
      descriptive statistics as mean, percent and range. Survival probabilities were
      estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and the significance of difference between
      the survival curves were calculate using log-rank test. Results: Uterine sarcomas
      are rare and aggressive tumours of uterus. Majority of these tumours present in
      early stage. Surgery remains the main treatment modality. Role of adjuvant
      radiation treatment remains controversial. Tumour stage is the most important
      prognostic factor.

TI  - Vulval Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3: A Clinico-Pathological Review in a Tertiary
      Care Centre Over 10 Years.
PG  - 334-339

AB  - Objectives: Vulval Intraepithelial Neoplasia 3 (VIN) is a chronic, premalignant
      condition affecting the vulval skin. The age standardised incidence is
      approximately one per 100,000 women, with a peak at 30-49 years of age, and has
      risen over recent decades. This study would analyse the pattern of presentation, 
      diagnosis, treatment and follow up of patients diagnosed with VIN 3 over a period
      of ten years at a tertiary care centre in India. Materials and Methods: This was 
      a retrospective study conducted on all patients diagnosed to have VIN 3 between 1
      January 2010 to 30 November 2019 in the Department of Gynaecologic Oncology,
      Christian Medical College, Vellore were included in this study. The outpatient
      records of the patients were obtained from an electronic registry. Results: A
      total of 18 patients were diagnosed of VIN 3 during this time period. Sixteen
      patients were older than 50 years. Abnormal PAP was noted in 10 patients (HSIL-7,
      LSIL-2, ASC-H-1). Four patients had coexisting VAIN 3. About 16 patients
      underwent primary simple vulvectomy or wide local excision. Two patients were
      managed conservatively. Nine patients had recurrence with mean disease free
      interval of 12.5 months (4-36 months). Cryotherapy was used in 2 patients.
      Imiquimod was used in 3 patients. Surgical margins was achieved in 7 patients out
      of which 5 patients had recurrence. About 50% of patients with involved margins
      on biopsy had recurrence. Mean duration of follow up was 17 months (4-105
      months). About 8 patients developed squamous cell carcinoma of genital tract on
      follow up. Conclusion: VIN 3 has a high rate of progression to invasive SCC.
      Regression of VIN is rare. Proper follow up and treatment of VIN 3 goes a long
      way in preventing the morbidity associated with vulval cancer.

PG  - 255-261
LID - 10.1007/s13224-021-01533-7 [doi]
AB  - Objective: 1. To determine the prevalence of pre malignant cervical lesions in
      HIV positive women using conventional Pap smear. 2. To determine the association 
      between various risk factors in HIV positive women and abnormal cytology on Pap
      smear. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Bangalore Medical College
      in which eligible HIV-positive women underwent Pap smear, human papillomavirus
      (HPV) testing and cervical biopsy. Methods: Retropositive women attending gynaec 
      OPD during the study period were taken into the study after taking informed
      consent. Women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were subjected to Pap smear. 
      Bethesda system of classification was used for reporting the Pap smear. Women
      with abnormal Pap smear were further evaluated by HPV DNA testing and cervical
      biopsy. Results: Cervical cytology was abnormal in 30% of the HIV-positive women,
      out of which 10% had HSIL, 15% had LSIL and 5% had ASCUS. Age at first sexual
      intercourse < 17 years (p = 0.009), past H/O STI (p = 0.0001), women with
      husband's having multiple sexual partners (p = 0.0001), women with CD4 count <
      350 cells/micro-litre (p = 0.0001) were significant risk factors associated with 
      abnormal Pap smear. Conclusion: Invasive cervical cancer is considered a
      preventable disease because of its long preinvasive state. Therefore, screening
      for premalignant cervical lesions represents an opportunity to prevent women
      developing cervical carcinoma.

TI  - Maternal and Perinatal Outcome of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome
      (PRES) in Patients with Eclampsia at Tertiary Health Care Centre.
PG  - 192-197
LID - 10.1007/s13224-021-01585-9 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and the related
      term reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) denote a
      constellation of clinical symptoms paired with key radiological findings.
      Eclampsia associated with PRES is a rare condition and remains a challenging
      diagnosis to make. There are only a few studies regarding PRES syndrome with a
      limited sample size. Our institution is a tertiary referral centre; hence, a good
      sample size of patients with eclampsia complicated with PRES syndrome is seen in 
      our study. The objective was to identify the maternal and neonatal outcomes in
      PRES with eclampsia. Methods: This study is a prospective observational study
      done in Government Medical College, Aurangabad, India from October 2018 to
      September 2020. In the present study, we have enrolled 63 cases, who satisfied
      inclusion and exclusion criteria during two years. All women admitted in the
      labour room of tertiary health care centre diagnosed with eclampsia with
      neurological symptoms during the study period were studied. Relevant data were
      obtained from the case file and compiled by common proforma. Analysis was done by
      SPSS (Statistical package for social sciences) Version 25th. Results: In patients
      with a confirmed diagnosis of PRES with eclampsia(n = 63), the mean age of the
      patient was 20.74 +/- 2.04 years, 23 (36.5%) patients had headache as premonitory
      symptoms, whereas 13(20.6%)patients had visual disturbances as the premonitory
      symptom. The mean gestational age at presentation was 34.4 +/- 2 weeks. 40(63.5%)
      patients were showing parieto-occipital region changes, and 24(38.1%) subjects
      were showing only occipital region involvement in CT brain. 12 (19.04%) subjects 
      were diagnosed with HELLP syndrome as a maternal complication, 07 (11.1%)
      subjects had Abruptio placentae. 26(41.3%) babies needed NICU admission, and 4
      (6.3%) babies had neonatal death. Conclusion: In pregnant patients presenting
      with seizure and neurological symptoms, a possibility of PRES should be
      considered. Proper diagnosis requires careful attention to clinical and
      radiographic presentation. In eclampsia with PRES patients, a timely intervention
      with anti-hypertensive, anti-cerebral oedema measures as well as management of
      other associated symptoms are required. Supplementary Information: The online
      version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13224-021-01585-9.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the prognostic role of pretreatment CD4 + , CD8 + T
      lymphocytes in predicting response to definite chemo radiotherapy in advanced
      cervical cancer. Design: A hospital-based prospective one-year follow-up study.
      Method: This observational study was conducted on 74 patients with advanced
      cervical cancer. Pretreatment CD4 + and CD8 + levels in cervical cancer tissue
      and peripheral blood was noted and quantitatively assessed in patients with
      complete remission or persistent disease after one year of follow-up. Results:
      There was a statistically significant association of tumour volume with the
      remission or persistence of disease. In peripheral blood, mean CD4 + score and
      CD4 + /CD8 + ratio were significantly higher while mean CD8 + score is
      significantly lower in patients with remission. Similar results were seen in
      tumour tissue as well. On Receiver Operating Curve analysis, the cut-off value of
      CD4 + , CD8 + and CD4 + /CD8 + ratio in predicting remission or persistent
      disease in peripheral blood was 20.09, 18.51 and 0.41 while in tumor tissue was
      19.71, 20.99 and 0.20, respectively. Conclusion: The patients with tumor volume <
      100 cm 2 have much higher chances of remission. The patients with higher CD4 +
      and CD4 + / CD8 + ratio, both in peripheral blood as well as tumor tissue, have
      higher chances of remission. The cut-off value of CD4 + , CD8 + and CD4 + /CD8 + 
      ratio in predicting remission or persistent disease in peripheral blood was
      20.09, 18.51 and 0.41 while in tumor tissue was 19.71, 20.99 and 0.20,
      respectively.

PG  - 101-110
LID - 10.1109/pacificvis53943.2022.00019 [doi]
AB  - The annual incidence of head and neck cancers (HNC) worldwide is more than
      550,000 cases, with around 300,000 deaths each year. However, the incidence rates
      and disease-characteristics of HNC differ between treatment centers and different
      populations, due to undetermined reasons, which may or not include socioeconomic 
      factors. The multi-faceted and multi-variate nature of the data in the context of
      the emerging field of health disparities research makes automated analysis
      impractical. Hence, we present a visual analysis approach to explore the health
      disparities in the data of HNC patients from two different cohorts at two cancer 
      care centers. Our approach integrates data from multiple sources, including
      census data and city data, with custom visual encodings and with a nearest
      neighbor approach. Our design, created in collaboration with oncology experts,
      makes it possible to analyze the patients' demographic, disease characteristics, 
      treatments and outcomes, and to make significant comparisons of these two cohorts
      and of individual patients. We evaluate this approach through two case studies
      performed with domain experts. The results demonstrate that this visual analysis 
      approach successfully accomplishes the goal of comparing two cohorts in terms of 
      different significant factors, and can provide insights into the main source of
      health disparities between the two centers.

AB  - Background: Early prediction of treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      (NACT) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive 
      breast cancer can facilitate timely adjustment of treatment regimens. We aimed to
      develop and validate a Siamese multi-task network (SMTN) for predicting
      pathological complete response (pCR) based on longitudinal ultrasound images at
      the early stage of NACT. Methods: In this multicentre, retrospective cohort
      study, a total of 393 patients with biopsy-proven HER2-positive breast cancer
      were retrospectively enrolled from three hospitals in china between December 16, 
      2013 and March 05, 2021, and allocated into a training cohort and two external
      validation cohorts. Patients receiving full cycles of NACT and with surgical
      pathological results available were eligible for inclusion. The key exclusion
      criteria were missing ultrasound images and/or clinicopathological
      characteristics. The proposed SMTN consists of two subnetworks that could be
      joined at multiple layers, which allowed for the integration of multi-scale
      features and extraction of dynamic information from longitudinal ultrasound
      images before and after the first /second cycles of NACT. We constructed the
      clinical model as a baseline using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
      Then the performance of SMTN was evaluated and compared with the clinical model. 
      Findings: The training cohort, comprising 215 patients, were selected from Yunnan
      Cancer Hospital. The two independent external validation cohorts, comprising 95
      and 83 patients, were selected from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, and
      Shanxi Cancer Hospital, respectively. The SMTN yielded an area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.986 (95% CI: 0.977-0.995), 0.902
      (95%CI: 0.856-0.948), and 0.957 (95%CI: 0.924-0.990) in the training cohort and
      two external validation cohorts, respectively, which were significantly higher
      than that those of the clinical model (AUC: 0.524-0.588, P all < 0.05). The AUCs 
      values of the SMTN within the anti-HER2 therapy subgroups were 0.833-0.972 in the
      two external validation cohorts. Moreover, 272 of 279 (97.5%) non-pCR patients
      (159 of 160 (99.4%), 53 of 54 (98.1%), and 60 of 65 (92.3%) in the training and
      two external validation cohorts, respectively) were successfully identified by
      the SMTN, suggesting that they could benefit from regime adjustment at the
      early-stage of NACT. Interpretation: The SMTN was able to predict pCR in the
      early-stage of NACT for HER2-positive breast cancer patients, which could guide
      clinicians in adjusting treatment regimes. Funding: Key-Area Research and

AB  - Background: Anxiety and depression are commonly recognized and prognostically
      relevant in cancer patients. The aim of this study was to explore the 3-year
      longitudinal changes in anxiety and depression, their risk factors, and
      prognostic value in patients with bladder cancer. Methods: Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) scores of 120
      postoperative bladder cancer patients and 100 healthy controls (HCs) were
      assessed. Additionally, the HADS-A and HADS-D scores of bladder cancer patients
      were determined at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post surgery. Results: HADS-A
      score (7.7 +/- 3.0 vs. 4.8 +/- 2.6), anxiety rate (38.3% vs. 9.0%), HADS-D score 
      (7.7 +/- 3.3 vs. 4.3 +/- 2.6), depression rate (40.0% vs. 11.0%), as well as
      anxiety degree and depression degree, were all increased in bladder cancer
      patients compared with HCs (all P < 0.001). Besides, the HADS-A score gradually
      increased from baseline to 3 years (P = 0.004), while the anxiety rate, HADS-D
      score, and depression rate did not change significantly (all P > 0.050). Gender, 
      tumor size, marriage status, hypertension, diversity, and lymph node (LN)
      metastasis were associated with anxiety or depression in patients with bladder
      cancer (all P < 0.050). Anxiety was associated with shortened overall survival
      (OS) (P = 0.024) but did not link with disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.201);
      depression was not correlated with either DFS or OS (both P > 0.050). Conclusion:
      The prevalence and severity of anxiety and depression are high in patients with
      bladder cancer, which are influenced by gender, tumor features, marriage status, 
      and hypertension; in addition, their correlation with survival is relatively
      weak.

TI  - Identification of potent and novel inhibitors against RAC1: a Rho family GTPase.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1007/s40203-022-00127-z [doi]
AB  - Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most common form of
      cancer worldwide. It has high incidence and mortality rate making it one of the
      top causes of cancer related deaths. Tremendous efforts have being made towards
      treatment of HNSCC but still the overall survival rate hasn't improved much.
      Unregulated activation of Rho GTPase Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1
      or Rac1 has been reported in various tumor such as HNSCC, breast cancer,
      pancreatic cancer, etc. Rac1 is significant in activation and regulation of
      multiple signaling pathways and it's aberrant activation leads to uncontrolled
      proliferation, invasion and metastasis which contributes to the hallmarks of
      cancer. Therefore for treating proliferative disorders such as cancer, inhibition
      of Rac1 could be a viable approach. Rho GTPases were earlier considered
      "undruggable" due to their picomolar binding affinity for their guanine
      nucleotides. In addition presence of high micromolar concentrations of GDP (> 30 
      mum) and GTP (> 300 mum) in the cell, led to unsuccessful attempts in
      identification of potent or selective nucleotide competitive GTPase inhibitors.
      Therefore we identified small molecule inhibitors that target the GEF binding
      site of the Rho GTPase instead of nucleotide binding site by performing high
      throughput screening, molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations
      and protein-ligand interaction studies. As a result of this study, we identified 
      four potential inhibitors against RAC1. This study provides a significant
      in-depth understanding of the Rho GTPases and can prove beneficial in the
      development of potential therapeutics against HNSCC.

AB  - Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) even with
      optimization may give low signal-to-background ratio and spatial resolution.
      Here, we adapted Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN)
      (originally developed by the Henikoff group) to develop CUT&RUN-qPCR. By studying
      the recruitment of selected proteins (but amenable to other proteins), we find
      that CUT&RUN-qPCR is more sensitive and gives better spatial resolution than
      ChIP-qPCR. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please

AB  - Wumei Pill (WMP) is a traditional Chinese herbal formulation and widely used to
      treat digestive system diseases in clinical. S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
      (AHCY) can catalyze the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine to adenosine and
      homocysteine in living organisms, and its abnormal expression is linked to the
      pathogenesis of many diseases including colorectal cancer (CRC). A previous study
      reported that WMP could prevent CRC in mice; however, the underlying mechanisms
      especially the roles of AHCY in WMP-induced anti-CRC remain largely unknown.
      Here, we investigated the regulatory roles and potential mechanisms of AHCY in
      WMP-induced anti-CRC. WMP notably alleviated the azoxymethane/dextran sulfate
      sodium- (AOM/DSS-) induced colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) in mice.
      Besides, WMP inhibited the inflammation and oxidative stress in AOM/DSS-induced
      CAC mice. AHCY was high expression in clinical samples of colon cancer compared
      to the adjacent tissues. WMP inhibited the AHCY expression in AOM/DSS-induced CAC
      mice. An in vitro study found that AHCY overexpression induced cell
      proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and tumor angiogenesis, whereas its
      knockdown impaired its oncogenic function. AHCY overexpression enhanced, while
      its knockdown weakened the inflammation and oxidative stress in colon cancer
      cells. Interestingly, WMP potently suppressed the hedgehog (Hh) signaling in
      AOM/DSS-induced CAC mice. A further study showed that AHCY overexpression
      activated the Hh signaling while AHCY knockdown inactivated the Hh signaling.
      Moreover, activation of the Hh signaling reversed the effect of AHCY silencing on
      inflammation and oxidative stress in vitro. In conclusion, WMP alleviated the
      AOM/DSS-induced CAC through inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress by
      regulating AHCY-mediated hedgehog signaling in mice. These findings uncovered a
      potential molecular mechanism underlying the anti-CAC effect of WMP and suggested
      WMP as a promising therapeutic candidate for CRC.

AB  - Cancer cells normally grow on soft surfaces due to impaired mechanosensing of the
      extracellular matrix rigidity. Upon restoration of proper mechanosensing, cancer 
      cells undergo apoptosis on soft surfaces (anoikis) like most normal cells.
      However, the link between mechanosensing and activation of anoikis is not clear. 
      Here we show that death associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1), a tumor suppressor
      that activates cell death, is directly linked to anoikis activation through
      rigidity sensing. We find that when rigidity sensing is decreased through
      inhibition of DAPK1 activity, cells are transformed for growth on soft matrices. 
      Further, DAPK1 catalyzes matrix adhesion assembly and is part of adhesions on
      rigid surfaces. This pathway involves DAPK1 phosphorylation of tropomyosin1.1,
      the talin1 head domain, and tyrosine phosphorylation of DAPK1 by Src. On soft
      surfaces, DAPK1 rapidly dissociates from the adhesion complexes and activates
      apoptosis as catalyzed by PTPN12 activity and talin1 head. Thus, DAPK1 is
      important for adhesion assembly on rigid surfaces and the activation of anoikis
      on soft surfaces through its binding to rigidity-sensing modules.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a heterogeneous disease with
      significant mortality and frequent recurrence. Prior efforts to transcriptionally
      classify HNSCC into groups of varying prognoses have identified four accepted
      molecular subtypes of the disease: Atypical (AT), Basal (BA), Classical (CL), and
      Mesenchymal (MS). Here, we investigate the active enhancer landscapes of these
      subtypes using representative HNSCC cell lines and identify samples belonging to 
      the AT subtype as having increased enhancer activity compared to the other 3
      HNSCC subtypes. Cell lines belonging to the AT subtype are more resistant to
      enhancer-blocking bromodomain inhibitors (BETi). Examination of nascent
      transcripts reveals that both AT TCGA tumors and cell lines express higher levels
      of enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcripts for enhancers controlling BETi resistance
      pathways, such as lipid metabolism and MAPK signaling. Additionally,
      investigation of higher-order chromatin structure suggests more enhancer-promoter
      (E-P) contacts in the AT subtype, including on genes identified in the eRNA
      analysis. Consistently, known BETi resistance pathways are upregulated upon
      exposure to these inhibitors. Together, our results identify that the AT subtype 
      of HNSCC is associated with higher enhancer activity, resistance to enhancer
      blockade, and increased signaling through pathways that could serve as future
      targets for sensitizing HNSCC to BET inhibition.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to describe the experiences of parents handling
      oral anticancer drugs in a home setting. METHODS: Parents of children with cancer
      were recruited from a paediatric oncology ward in Sweden to participate in an
      interview. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to qualitative 
      content analysis. RESULTS: We found the following categories and subcategories:
      parents' views on the provided information-lack of, too little or contradictory
      information, and parents' preferences for information delivery; safety over time;
      correct drug dose; and drug administration. As time passed, most parents adapted 
      to their child's illness, felt safer and found it easier to take in and process
      any given information. Parents preferred information in different formats
      (written, movie clips and orally) and in their mother tongue. Many parents were
      aware of the importance of giving an accurate dose to their child and described
      the process of drug administration as overwhelming. CONCLUSION: Parents need to
      be provided with accurate, timely, nonconflicting and repeated information-in
      different forms and in their mother tongue-on how to handle oral anticancer drugs
      at home.

AB  - Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is a bone marrow failure syndrome with
      extrahematopoietic abnormalities. DC is a paradigmatic telomere biology disorder 
      (TBD) caused by germline mutations in genes responsible for telomere maintenance 
      including TERT. Cryptic TBD is a bone marrow failure syndrome due to premature
      telomere shortening but without additional symptoms, frequently clinically
      indistinguishable from severe aplastic anemia (SAA) or hypoplastic
      myelodysplastic syndrome. We present the complex diagnostic pathway in a boy with
      a rare germline p.Thr726Met TERT variant with previous reports of SAA association
      and compromised enzymatic function who presented with juvenile myelomonocytic
      leukemia, which is a rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm of
      childhood.

TI  - Radiation enhances the efficacy of EGFR-targeted CAR-T cells against
      triple-negative breast cancer by activating NF-kappaB/Icam1 signaling.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype
      with limited treatment options. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is
      reported to be expressed in 50% to 75% of TNBC patients, making it a promising
      target for cancer treatment. Here we show that EGFR-targeted Chimeric Antigen
      Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy combined with radiotherapy provides enhanced
      antitumor efficacy in immunocompetent and immunodeficient orthotopic TNBC mice.
      Intriguingly, this combination therapy resulted in a substantial increase in the 
      number of tumor-infiltrating CAR-T cells. The efficacy of this combination was
      independent of tumor radiosensitivity and lymphodepleting preconditioning.
      Cytokine profiling showed that this combination did not increase the risk of
      cytokine release syndrome (CRS). RNA-seq analysis revealed that EGFR-targeting
      CAR-T therapy combined with radiotherapy increased the infiltration of CD8(+) T
      and NK cells into tumors. Mechanistically, radiation significantly increased
      Icam1 expression on TNBC cells via activating NF-kappaB signaling, thereby
      promoting CAR-T cell infiltration and killing. These results suggest that CAR-T
      therapy combined with radiotherapy may be a promising strategy for TNBC
      treatment.

TI  - Unexpected deaths after endocrine surgery: learning from rare events using a
      national audit of surgical mortality.
LID - znac276 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjs/znac276 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mortality rate is low in endocrine surgery, making it a difficult
      outcome to use for quality improvement in individual units. Lessons from
      population data sets are of value in improving outcomes. Data from the Australian
      and New Zealand Audit of Surgical Mortality (ANZASM) were used here to understand
      and elucidate potential systems issues that may contribute to preventable deaths.
      METHODS: ANZASM data relating to 30-day mortality after thyroidectomy,
      parathyroidectomy, and adrenalectomy from 2009 to 2020 were reviewed. Mortality
      rates were calculated using billing data. Thematic analysis of independent
      assessor reports was conducted to produce a coding framework. RESULTS: A total of
      67 deaths were reported, with an estimated mortality rate of 0.03-0.07 per cent
      (38 for thyroidectomy (0.03-0.06 per cent), 16 for parathyroidectomy (0.03-0.06
      per cent), 13 for adrenalectomy (0.15-0.33 per cent)). Twenty-seven deaths (40
      per cent) were precipitated by clinically significant adverse events, and 18 (27 
      per cent) were judged to be preventable by independent ANZASM assessors.
      Recurrent themes included inadequate preoperative assessment, lack of
      anticipation of intraoperative pitfalls, and failure to recognize and effectively
      address postoperative complications. Several novel themes were reiterated, such
      as occult ischaemic heart disease associated with death after parathyroid
      surgery, unexpected intraoperative difficulties from adrenal metastasis, and
      complications due to anticoagulation therapy after thyroid surgery. CONCLUSION:
      This study represents a large-scale national report of deaths after endocrine
      surgery and provides insights into these rare events. Although the overall
      mortality rate is low, 27 per cent of deaths involved systems issues that were
      preventable following independent peer review.

      nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation.
PG  - e29927
LID - 10.1002/pbc.29927 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications are common in sickle cell disease (SCD). The 
      use of standard myeloablative conditioning regimens may increase the risk of lung
      injury. We report serial pulmonary function testing (PFT) outcomes in children
      with SCD who underwent a matched-sibling donor hematopoietic cell transplantation
      (HCT) using nonmyeloablative (NMA) protocol. METHODS: This is a retrospective
      chart review describing pulmonary outcomes in pediatric patients post HCT. The
      conditioning regimen consisted of alemtuzumab and a single fraction of 300 cGy of
      total body irradiation (TBI), and sirolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 
      prophylaxis. Serial PFT testing was performed pre and post HCT. The evaluated
      pulmonary measures included: forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory
      volume in the first second (FEV1 ), FEV1 /FVC, and forced expiratory flow
      (FEF25-75 ). RESULTS: Twelve subjects were included in the analysis. All had HbSS
      genotype, and five of the 12 patients had one or more episodes of acute chest
      syndrome prior to HCT. Serial PFT measures were completed per patient. No patient
      was diagnosed with chronic GVHD of any organ post HCT. The baseline median FVC,
      FEV1 , FEV1 /FVC, and FEF25-75 were within the normal range and remained
      relatively unchanged post HCT. A linear mixed effects model, adjusting for gender
      and time from HCT, suggested no significant relationship between HCT and PFT
      parameters, including FVC, FEV1 , and FEV1 /FVC. Interestingly, the FEF25-75
      results exhibited a shift in the means post HCT (pre-HCT 86.2% predicted and
      post-HCT 93.05% predicted, p-value = .018). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that
      HCT in children with SCD may prevent the anticipated decline in pulmonary
      function over time.

TI  - Meditation reduces brain activity in the default mode network in children with
      active cancer and survivors.
PG  - e29917
LID - 10.1002/pbc.29917 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence demonstrates that meditation can lower pain and
      emotional distress in adults, and more recently, in children. Children may
      benefit from meditation given its accessibility across a variety of settings
      (e.g., surgical preparation). Recent neuroimaging studies in adults suggest that 
      meditation techniques are neurobiologically distinct from other forms of emotion 
      regulation, such as distraction, that rely on prefrontal control mechanisms,
      which are underdeveloped in youth. Rather, meditation techniques may not rely on 
      "top-down" prefrontal control and may therefore be utilized across the lifespan. 
      PROCEDURE: We examined neural activation in children with cancer, a potentially
      distressing diagnosis. During neuroimaging, children viewed distress-inducing
      video clips while using martial arts-based meditation (focused attention, mindful
      acceptance) or non-meditation (distraction) emotion regulation techniques. In a
      third condition (control), participants passively viewed the video clip. RESULTS:
      We found that meditation techniques were associated with lower activation in
      default mode network (DMN) regions, including the medial frontal cortex,
      precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex, compared to the control condition.
      Additionally, we found evidence that meditation techniques may be more effective 
      for modulating DMN activity than distraction. There were no differences in
      self-reported distress ratings between conditions. CONCLUSION: Together, these
      findings suggest that martial arts-based meditation modulates negative
      self-referential processing associated with the DMN, and may have implications
      for the management of pediatric pain and negative emotion.

TI  - DNA-Based Nanoprobes for Simultaneous Detection of Telomerase and Correlated
      Biomolecules.
LID - 10.1002/cbic.202200307 [doi]
AB  - Telomerase (TE), a ribonucleoprotein reverse transcriptase, is enzymatically
      activated in most tumor cells and is responsible for promoting tumor progression 
      and malignancy by enabling replicative immortality of cancer cells. TE has become
      an important hallmark for cancer diagnosis and a potential therapy target.
      Therefore, accurate and in site detection of TE activity, especially the
      simultaneous imaging of TE activity and its correlated biomolecules, is highly
      essential to medical diagnostics and therapeutics. DNA-based nanoprobes, with
      their effective cell penetration capability and programmability, are the most
      advantageous for detection of intracellular TE activity. This concept article
      introduces the recent strategies for in situ sensing and imaging of TE activity, 
      with a focus on simultaneous detection of TE and related biomolecules, and
      provides challenges and perspectives for the development of new strategies for
      such correlated imaging.

TI  - Use of electronic medical records to monitor the safe and effective prescribing
      of medicinal cannabis: is it feasible?
LID - 10.1071/PY22054 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: General practitioners are well positioned to contribute to the
      pharmacovigilance of medical cannabis via the general practice electronic medical
      record (EMR). The aim of this research is to interrogate de-identified patient
      data from the Patron primary care data repository for reports of medicinal
      cannabis to ascertain the feasibility of using EMRs to monitor medicinal cannabis
      prescribing in Australia. METHODS: EMR rule-based digital phenotyping of 1 164
      846 active patients from 109 practices was undertaken to investigate reports of
      medicinal cannabis use from September 2017 to September 2020. RESULTS: Eighty
      patients with 170 prescriptions of medicinal cannabis were identified in the
      Patron repository. Reasons for prescription included anxiety, multiple sclerosis,
      cancer, nausea, and Crohn's disease. Nine patients showed symptoms of a possible 
      adverse event, including depression, motor vehicle accident, gastrointestinal
      symptoms, and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: The recording of medicinal cannabis effects
      in the patient EMR provides potential for medicinal cannabis monitoring in the
      community. This is especially feasible if monitoring were to be embedded into
      general practitioner workflow.

TI  - Construction of Circadian Clock Signature for Tumor Microenvironment in
      Predicting Survival for Cutaneous Melanoma.
LID - 10.2174/1381612828666220802114517 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We explored circadian clock-related genes (CCRG) to establish a risk
      model and identify associations with the tumor immune microenvironment in
      cutaneous melanoma (CM). METHODS: Circadian clock genes were downloaded from
      Circadian Gene Database. To explore CM-related circadian clock genes, we combined
      multivariate cox regression associated with least absolute shrinkage and
      selection operator (LASSO) regression in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and
      validated it in the GSE65904 dataset. Time-dependent receiver operating
      characteristic curve (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis were calculated to determine
      a CCRG risk score model. In addition, the overall survival nomograms of
      clinicopathological factors and circadian clock-associated gene signatures.
      Additionally, we evaluated the connection between circadian clock-associated
      genes with immune checkpoint inhibitors and immune cell infiltration. RESULTS:
      Two circadian-clock-related signatures were established. The risk model included 
      SEMA4D (p < 0.001, HR: 0.709, 95% CI: 0.581 to 0.867) and SOD-2 (p<=0.009, HR:
      0.790, 95% CI: 0.663 to 0.944) in patients with TCGA melanoma. The risk model was
      based on two CCRGs enriched in base excision repair, glycosylphosphatidyl (GPI ),
      and one carbon of the folate pathway. The overall survival was lower in the
      high-risk group. In addition, the circadian-clock signature may be able to
      evaluate the immunotherapy response. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a
      circadian signature to characterize the clinical significance and tumor
      microenvironment of cutaneous melanoma, revealing that circadian rhythms may
      impact cutaneous melanoma.

      Cancer.

AB  - Breast cancer represents a health concern worldwide for being the leading cause
      of cancer-related women's death. The main challenge for breast cancer treatment
      involves its heterogeneous nature with distinct clinical outcomes. It is
      clinically categorized into five subtypes: luminal A; luminal B, HER2-positive,
      luminal-HER, and triple-negative. Despite the significant advances in the past
      decades, critical issues involving the development of efficient target-specific
      therapies and overcoming treatment resistance still need to be better addressed. 
      OMICs-based strategies have marked a revolution in cancer biology comprehension
      in the past two decades. It is a consensus that Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) 
      is the primary source of this revolution and the development of relevant
      consortia translating pharmacogenomics into clinical practice. Still, new
      approaches, such as CRISPR editing and epigenomic sequencing are becoming
      essential for target and biomarker discoveries. Here, we discuss genomics and
      epigenomics techniques, how they have been applied in clinical management and to 
      improve therapeutic strategies in breast cancer, as well as the pharmacogenomics 
      translation into the current and upcoming clinical routine.

AB  - Nanomaterials are indeed a nanoscale technology that deals with the creation,
      evaluation, fabrication, and utilization of systems at the nanometre scale by
      manipulating their size and shape. We consider natural polysaccharides such as
      promising polysaccharides, which are biodegradable, nontoxic, abundant, and
      inexpensive bio-polymeric precursors for preparing the materials of choice in
      various industries. The aim is to review different methods to produce
      hydrophobically modified Abelmoschus esculentus nanoparticles and study the
      evaluation processes of these nanoparticles as given in the literature. It proved
      the benefits of derivatives of gum by introducing different chemical groups. The 
      chemical functionalization of gum mainly includes the esterification,
      etherification, and cross-linking reactions of the hydroxyl groups and contains a
      special fibre which takes sugar levels in the blood under control, providing a
      sugar quantity acceptable for the bowels. Okra contains mucilage that helps
      remove poisonous chemicals and bad cholesterol, often overloads the liver.
      Recovering from psychological conditions, like depression, general weakness, and 
      joint healthiness, can be done with Okra. Someone additionally applied it for
      pulmonary inflammation, bowel irritation, and sore throat. Purgative properties
      okra possesses are beneficial for bowel purification. It is used to counteract
      the acids. Fibre okra contains is a valuable nutrient for intestinal
      microorganisms and ensures proper intestine functionality. It also protects the
      mucosa of the digestive tract by covering them with an extra layer because of its
      alkaline nature. Nanotechnology has emerged as a critical component of
      pharmaceutics, with many applications in drug carriers of interest aimed at
      improving drug clinical outcomes such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, wound care
      management, atopic dermatitis, cosmeceutical, etc and discussed briefly the
      beneficial outcomes of this review.

TI  - A brief review of pharmacokinetic assessments of vancomycin in special groups of 
      patients with altered pharmacokinetic parameters.
LID - 10.2174/1574886317666220801124718 [doi]
AB  - Vancomycin is considered the drug of choice against many Gram-positive bacterial 
      infections. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is essential to achieve an optimum 
      clinical response and avoid vancomycin-induced adverse reactions including
      nephrotoxicity. Although different studies are available on vancomycin TDM, still
      there are controversies regarding the selection among different pharmacokinetic
      parameters including trough concentration, the area under the curve to minimum
      inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC24h/MIC), AUC of intervals, elimination
      constant, and vancomycin clearance. In this review, different pharmacokinetic
      parameters for vancomycin TDM have been discussed along with corresponding
      advantages and disadvantages. Also, vancomycin pharmacokinetic assessments are
      discussed in patients with altered pharmacokinetic parameters including those
      with renal and/or hepatic failure, critically ill patients, patients with burn
      injuries, intravenous drug users, obese and morbidly obese patients, those with
      cancer, patients undergoing organ transplantation, and vancomycin administration 
      during pregnancy and lactation. An individualized dosing regimen is required to
      guarantee the optimum therapeutic responses and minimize adverse reactions
      including acute kidney injury in these special groups of patients. According to
      the pharmacoeconomic data on vancomycin TDM, pharmacokinetic assessments would be
      cost-effective in patients with altered pharmacokinetics and are associated with 
      shorter hospitalization period, faster clinical stability status, and shorter
      courses of inpatient vancomycin administration.

TI  - A recent update on the epigenetic repertoire and chromatin modifying therapy in
      diabetes mellitus - A comprehensive review.

AB  - Several epigenome studies reported the ability of genes to modulate the
      lipogenic, and glucogenic pathways during insulin signaling as well as the other 
      pathways involved in the cardiometabolic diseases. Epigenetic plasticity and
      oxidative stress are interrelated in the pathophysiology of the insulin
      resistance (IR) and cardiometabolic disease conditions. The aim of this review is
      to ascertain the previous research evidences pertinent to the role of epigenome
      and the variations of histone and non-histone proteins during cardiometabolic
      disease conditions, and insulin signaling finally to develop effective
      disease-based epigenetic biomarkers and epigenetics-based chromatic therapy.
      Several public databases including 'PubMed, National Library of Medicine, and
      Medline, and google scholar' were searched for the peer-reviewed & published
      reports. This study delineated the consistent body of evidences regarding the
      epigenetic alterations of DNA/histone complexes pertinent to oxidative stress,
      insulin signaling, metabolic cardiomyopathy, and endothelial dysfunction in the
      patients with cardiometabolic diseases, T2DM. It has been described that both DNA
      methylation as well as the post-translational histone alterations across visceral
      and subcutaneous adipose tissue could facilitate gene transcription to modulate
      the inflammation, lipogenesis and adipogenesis as complex network of
      chromatinmodifying enzymatic proteins involved in the defensive insulin signaling
      across vasculature in the patients with cardiometabolic diseases. Resveratrol,
      vornistat, trichostatin, and apabetalone are reported to have significant
      implications as epigenetic modulators. Based on the epigenetic alterations, a
      wide-range of protein/gene markers such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-gamma
      (IFNgamma) genes may be considered as biomarkers in these patients due to their
      ability for polarization of immune cells involved in tissue inflammation and
      atherosclerosis. Hence, it is crucial to unravel the cell specific epigenetic
      information in advance in order to develop individual risk assessment strategies 
      for chromatin modifying therapies in the patients with cardiometabolic diseases.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of flavonoids on insulin-like
      growth factor and insulin-like growth factor binding protein and incidence of
      breast cancer.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220801164740 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) is associated with breast cancer
      in menopausal women. Naturally occurring biomolecules found in common dietary
      protocols such as flavonoids, play a key role in the inhibition and treatment of 
      cancer. In-vitro/in-vivo studies showed that treatment involving flavonoids led
      to a reduced risk of breast cancer due to the decrease of IGF-1 level in addition
      to an increased insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-3. However,
      clinical studies did not show conclusive results in this regard because they are 
      contradictory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was finding the effect of 
      flavonoids on IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and the incidence of breast cancer. METHODS: This
      systematic review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and
      EMBASE databases for collecting results about the clinical use of flavonoids and 
      their effects on breast cancer. After eliminating duplicate articles, the title
      and abstract of the remaining articles were examined in thematic communication
      and related clinical articles were selected and studied based on inclusion
      criteria. The data were extracted from each article, then statistical analysis
      subsequently carried out by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. RESULTS: The results
      showed that the effect of flavonoids on changes of IGF1 and IGFBP-3 were not
      statistically significant. No significant heterogeneity was detected across the
      studies. Pooled effect size also indicated that the mean change was not
      statistically significant. No significant heterogeneity was detected across the
      studies. There was no evidence of publication bias for IGF1 and IGFBP-3.
      CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis study suggests that flavonoids supplementations
      have no significant effect on IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and high soy diet has beneficial 
      effects on IGF system components, which might be useful in breast cancer.

TI  - The fractal viewpoint of tumors and nanoparticles.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220801152347 [doi]
AB  - Even though the promising therapies against cancer are rapidly improved, the
      oncology patients population has seen exponential growth, placing cancer in 5th
      place among the ten deadliest diseases. Efficient drug delivery systems must
      overcome multiple barriers and maximize drug delivery to the target tumors,
      limiting the side effects simultaneously. Since the first observation of the
      quantum tunneling phenomenon, many multidisciplinary studies have offered
      quantum-inspired solutions to optimized tumor mapping and efficient nanodrug
      design. The property of a wave function to propagate through a potential barrier 
      offer the capability of obtaining 3D surface profiles using imaging of individual
      atoms on the surface of a material. The application of quantum tunneling on a
      scanning tunneling microscope offers an exact surface roughness mapping of tumors
      and pharmaceutical particles. Critical elements to cancer nanotherapeutics apply 
      the fractal theory and calculate the fractal dimension for efficient tumor
      surface imaging at the atomic level. This review study presents the latest
      biological approaches to cancer management based on fractal geometry.

TI  - Research Progress on Small Molecules Inhibitors Targeting TRK Kinases.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220801145639 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trk gene fusions are an important driver in the development of
      cancers including secretory breast cancer and infantile congenital sarcoma. Since
      the first generation of small molecule Trk inhibitors (Larotrectinib and
      Entrectinib) came to market, research on small molecule TRK inhibitors,
      especially second-generation inhibitors that break through the resistance
      problem, has developed rapidly. Therefore, this article focuses on the research
      progress of first-generation drugs and second-generation drugs that breakthrough 
      drug resistance. METHODS: We use the database to search for relevant and
      cutting-edge documents, and then filter and select it based on the content. The
      articles are analyzed and classified, and finally, write articles according to
      themes. RESULT: The phenomenon of Trk protein fusion and its relation to tumors
      is first described, followed by an explanation of the composition and signaling
      pathways of Trk kinases. The representative Trk inhibitors and the development of
      novel Trk inhibitors are classified according to whether they overcome drug
      resistance problems. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a theoretical reference for 
      the development of novel inhibitors by introducing and summarizing the
      representative and novel Trk inhibitors that break through the drug resistance
      problem.

      study quality, and ta meta-analysis was performed to retrieve pooled estimates.
      Chi squared tests and I2 statistics were used to assess heterogeneity. Egger's
      test and funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. Results Literature
      search yielded 20 studies featuring data on 1,973 patients. The majority of the
      studies had low bias risk. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 96% (95%
      CI: 91%-98%) and 93% (95% CI: 89%-95%), respectively. The LRP and LRN estimates
      were in the left upper quadrant of the LR scattergram, indicating that F18-FDG
      PET/CT can be utilized for both confirmation and exclusion. The AUC was 0.98 (95%
      CI: 0.92-0.99). Fagan's nomogram showed that F18-FDG PET/CT had good clinical
      utility for recurrent NSCLC diagnosis. There was considerable between-study
      variability (p=0.02). Funnel plot was asymmetrical, indicating the possibility of
      publication bias. Conclusion This meta-analysis found FDG-PET/CT to be highly
      accurate for identifying NSCLC recurrence. However, more studies assessing this
      modality across different patient situations is required to strengthen the
      argument for changing international guidelines and practices.

TI  - Respiratory Symptoms After Smoking Cessation among College Students.
PG  - 215-219
LID - 10.1089/ped.2011.0097 [doi]
AB  - Data on respiratory symptoms after smoking cessation are available for mature
      adults, but for young adults these data are limited to observational studies.
      This retrospective analysis of smoking cessation trials addresses the gap. A
      cohort of 18- to 24-year-olds without chronic respiratory illness was developed
      from 2 randomized trials of behavioral interventions versus standard care to
      promote smoking cessation. This secondary analysis was performed to determine
      whether short-term respiratory health improvements occurred among those who
      achieved smoking cessation for 2 weeks or more. Self-reported respiratory
      symptoms were assessed at baseline and last follow-up. The sample numbered 327,
      60% smoked 5-10 cigarettes a day and 56% smoked for 1-5 years. Abstinence periods
      among those achieving cessation ranged from 2 to 78 weeks. The mean overall
      baseline respiratory symptom score was 14.3, standard deviation (SD)=11.5.
      Respiratory symptoms for those achieving cessation were mean=13.3, SD=11.2,
      decreasing to mean=3.8, SD=5.9 symptom days at the last follow-up. Baseline
      symptoms for those who continued smoking were mean=14.6, SD=11.6, decreasing to
      mean=10.3, SD=10.3 at follow-up. Five fewer respiratory symptom days per week
      were noted for those who stopped smoking (mean=5.2, SD=1.5, P<0.0001). Smoking
      cessation is associated with reduced respiratory symptoms. Feedback of short-term
      health consequences may be relevant to younger populations who may perceive
      smoking hazards as in the distant future.

TI  - Neoantigen-based cancer vaccination using chimeric RNA-loaded dendritic
      cell-derived extracellular vesicles.
PG  - e12243
LID - 10.1002/jev2.12243 [doi]
AB  - Cancer vaccines critically rely on the availability of targetable immunogenic
      cancer-specific neoepitopes. However, mutation-based immunogenic neoantigens are 
      rare or even non-existent in subgroups of cancer types. To address this issue, we
      exploited a cancer-specific aberrant transcription-induced chimeric RNA,
      designated A-Pas chiRNA, as a possible source of clinically relevant and
      targetable neoantigens. A-Pas chiRNA encodes a recently discovered
      cancer-specific chimeric protein that comprises full-length astrotactin-2 (ASTN2)
      C-terminally fused in-frame to the antisense sequence of the 18(th) intron of
      pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPPA). We used extracellular vesicles
      (EVs) from A-Pas chiRNA-transfected dendritic cells (DCs) to produce the
      cell-free anticancer vaccine DEXA-P . Treatment of immunocompetent cancer-bearing
      mice with DEXA-P inhibited tumour growth and prolonged animal survival. In
      summary, we demonstrate for the first time that cancer-specific
      transcription-induced chimeric RNAs can be exploited to produce a cell-free
      cancer vaccine that induces potent CD8(+) T cell-mediated anticancer immunity.
      Our novel approach may be particularly useful for developing cancer vaccines to
      treat malignancies with low mutational burden or without mutation-based antigens.
      Moreover, this cell-free anticancer vaccine approach may offer several practical 
      advantages over cell-based vaccines, such as ease of scalability and genetic
      modifiability as well as enhanced shelf life.

TI  - MicroRNAs and Long Non-coding RNAs as Novel Targets in Anti-cancer Drug
      Development.
LID - 10.2174/1389201023666220803150431 [doi]
AB  - Non-coding RNAs comprise the majority of RNAs that have been transcribed from the
      human genome, and these non-coding RNAs have essential regulatory roles in the
      cellular processes. They have been discovered to influence the expression of the 
      genes, including tumor-suppressive and oncogenes, that establish the non-coding
      RNAs as novel targets for anti-cancer drug development. Among non-coding RNAs,
      microRNAs have been extensively studied in terms of cancer biology, and some
      microRNA-based therapeutics have been reached in clinical studies. Even though
      most of the research regarding targeting non-coding RNAs for anti-cancer drug
      development focused on microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs have also started to gain 
      importance as potential therapeutic targets for cancer therapy. In this chapter, 
      the strategies and importance of targeting microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs
      will be described, along with the clinical studies that involve microRNA-based
      cancer therapeutics and preclinical studies that involve long non-coding
      RNA-based therapeutics. Finally, the delivery strategies that have great
      importance in the effective delivery of the non-coding RNA-based cancer
      therapeutics, hence the therapy's effectiveness, will be described.

      Prevention.
LID - 10.2174/1874467215666220803125822 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer is a leading cause of death and a severe threat to global
      public health. Organoid, as a novel 3D in vitro model, has been applied in
      various tumor related studies regarding its apparent advantages. The organoid is 
      mainly constructed by Matrigel-depended 3D culture system, Air-Liquid Interface
      (ALI) culture, and Microfluidic culture or Organ-on-chips platform. For the
      application in carcinogenesis studies, organoid model may favor depicting
      initiative hallmarks and identifying potential intervening targets, investigating
      driver genes of carcinogenesis, and identifying known or unknown risk or
      protective factors. CONCLUSION: In this review, we discussed different organoid
      construction methods and their properties. We also noted that tumor organoids can
      portray initiative hallmarks and identify possible intervening targets, as well
      as explore carcinogenesis driver genes and uncover known or unknown risk or
      protective factors. Organoid systems have been used to identify tumor-preventive 
      drugs such as oligomeric proanthocyanidins, Vitamin D, n-3 PUFAs, and
      pomegranate. The current evidence underscores the organoid model's potential
      importance in developing innovative tumor-prevention techniques.

AB  - Identifying cancer genomes has provided acuity into somatically altered genes
      athwart tumors, transformed our understanding of biology, and helped us design
      therapeutic strategies. Though the action of most cancer cells remains furtive
      but many features of cancer surpass their genomes. Consequently, the
      characterization of tumor genome does not affect the treatment of many patients. 
      Strategies to know the circuity and function of cancer genes provide
      corresponding methods to explicate both non-oncogene and oncogene deficiencies.
      The emerging techniques specify that the therapeutic targets produced by
      non-oncogene deficiencies are much grander than the mutated genes. In the present
      review a framework of the long-drawn-out list of cancer targets viz. synthetic
      lethal targets, oncogene dependence, response to DNA damage, tumor suppressor
      rescue, metabolic susceptibility, protein-protein interaction, cell state or
      master regulators, targeting immune cells, fibroblasts etc. giving innovative
      prospects for clinical translation are discussed.

TI  - Pathway linking Emotional Suppression to Depression and Anxiety in Cancer
      Patients undergoing Chemotherapy: The Mediating Role of Ego-strength.
LID - 10.2174/1874609815666220804123152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ego-strength refers to the individual's psychosocial capacity to
      self-regulate their emotions in the face of stress, developed over the course of 
      the lifespan. Ego-strength may have an important role in understanding
      psychological adaptation to cancer, especially when considering the effects of
      emotional suppression in cancer populations. In the present study, we examined
      the effects of ego-strength and emotional suppression on depression and anxiety
      in patients coping with cancer. We also tested whether ego-strength may mediate
      the relationship between emotional suppression and psychological distress in
      cancer. METHODS: 120 cancer patients were recruited from a private hospital in
      Tabriz to complete baseline questionnaires. Depression, anxiety, ego-strength and
      emotional suppression were assessed by BDI-II, BAI, PIES and WAI respectively.
      Mediation models were tested using structural equation modeling, controlling for 
      age and gender. RESULTS: Emotional suppression was positively associated with
      depression and anxiety, and negatively associated with ego-strength. Ego-strength
      was negatively associated with depression and anxiety. Ego-strength partially
      mediated the relationship between emotional suppression and depression, and fully
      mediated the relationship between emotional suppression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: 
      Ego-strength may help prevent the onset or unfavorable course of depression and
      anxiety in cancer patients.

      Structural Analogs.

AB  - Cancer is known as a notorious disease responsible for threatening millions of
      lives every year. Natural products which act by disrupting the microtubule
      assembly and dynamics have proven to be highly successful as anti-cancer agents
      but their high toxicity owing to lower selectivity has limited their usage.
      Recently, Noscapine (NOS), a known anti-tussive, has come out to be an effective 
      anti-tubulin candidate with far lesser toxicity. Since its first report as an
      anti-mitotic agent in 1998, NOS has been extensively studied and modified by
      various group of researchers to optimize its anti-tubulin activity. In this
      review, the recent advancements pertaining to potential of these therapeutic
      candidates against various cancers have been compiled and analyzed for their
      inhibitory mechanism in distinct health conditions. It has been observed that the
      non-polar substitutions (e.g., halides, aryl groups) at specific sites
      (9-position and N-sites of isoquinoline ring; and modification of a methoxy
      group) have enhanced effect on efficacy. The mechanistic studies of NOS and its
      modified analogs have shown their inhibitory action primarily through interaction
      with microtubules dynamics thus disrupting the cell-cycle and leading to
      apoptosis. This review highlights the latest research in the field by providing a
      rich resource for the researchers to have a hands-on analysis of NOS analogues
      and the inhibitory action in comparison to other microtubule disrupting
      anti-cancer agents. The article also documents the newer investigations in
      studying the potential of noscapine analogs as possible anti-microbial and
      antiviral agents.

TI  - Rap2A/p-ERK1/2 is involved in glioma proliferation and migration.
LID - 10.2174/1566524022666220804152049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gliomas, the most common and malignant primary tumors, relate to the 
      highest mortality rate of all central nervous system cancers. Previously, it has 
      been demonstrated that Rap2A plays an essential role in tumor growth in human
      cancer cell lines. However, it remains largely unclear as to whether and how
      Rap2A is involved in the development of gliomas. In the current study, the role
      of Rap2A in glioma and its specific molecular mechanism are investigated by our
      group. METHODS: Expression of Rap2A was examined in glioma cell lines and human
      normal astrocyte cells using Western blot analysis. Using the CCK-8 cell
      proliferation assay, wound healing assay, and transwell migration assay, we
      elucidated the role of Rap2A in glioma cell proliferation and migration. Levels
      of E-cadherin, vimentin and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were also determined using 
      Western blot. RESULTS: The results suggested that Rap2A expression was remarkably
      decreased in glioma cells compared to the normal astrocyte cells. Overexpression 
      of Rap2A prominently suppressed cell proliferation and migration as well as
      enhanced E-cadherin expression and reduced vimentin level in both U87 and U251
      cells. In vivo assay proved that Rap2A overexpression slowed tumor growth of
      glioma. In particular, Rap2A overexpression remarkably inhibited ERK1/2
      phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our findings demonstrated that Rap2A
      functioned as a tumor suppressor via modulating the ERK1/2 signaling pathway,
      which may be a potential therapeutic candidate for treating glioma.

      anti-cancer Protacs based molecules.
LID - 10.2174/0929867329666220803112409 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PROTACs is an emerging technique that addresses the disease causing
      proteins by targeting protein degradation. PROTACs molecules are bifunctional
      small molecules that simultaneously bind to the protein of interest (POIs) and an
      E3 ligase followed by ubiquitination and degradation of the protein of interest
      by the proteasome. OBJECTIVE: PROTACs technology offers many advantages over
      classical inhibition such as PROTACs molecules can target intracellular proteins 
      regardless of their function and have good tissue distribution. They are capable 
      to target mutated and overexpressed proteins, thus potent molecules with high
      degradation selectivity can be designed. Moreover, PROTACs molecules can target
      the undruggable proteome which makes almost 85% of human proteins. Several
      PROTACs based compounds have exhibited high therapeutic potency and some of them 
      are currently under clinical trials. METHODS: Current article gives a
      comprehensive overview of the current development of PROTACs based anticancer
      compounds along with the structure-activity relationship of the reported
      molecules. RESULTS: The development in PROTACs based compounds and related
      research regarding medicinal chemistry are one of the most active and hot topics 
      for research. CONCLUSION: It is believed that the current review article can be
      helpful to understand the logical design of more efficacious PROTACs based
      molecules with less toxicity and more selectivity.

TI  - Detection of an EML4-ALK fusion mutation secondary to epidermal growth factor
      receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy for lung cancer: a case
      report.
PG  - 2503-2509
LID - 10.21037/apm-22-744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant (EGFR-mutant) advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, EGFR-tyrosine inhibitors such as
      gefitinib, erlotinib, and osimertinib, are recommended as the preferred
      first-line treatment. Unfortunately, relevant drug resistance is often inevitable
      and for first and second generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), drug 
      resistance most commonly (50-60% of cases) occurs at the secondary point mutation
      T790M. Second-line treatments may include administering the third generation of
      EGFR-TKIs, such as osimertinib and almonertinib. In a few relevant studies,
      rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene was detected in
      patients with T790M mutation after drug resistance to osimertinib re-occurred
      following administration as a second-line treatment. The studies concluded that
      ALK rearrangement is a rare but critical drug resistance mechanism for
      osimertinib. However, to date, it remains unclear whether almonertinib also
      triggers the same ALK rearrangement. The current case study is the first one
      detailing the detection of an ALK rearrangement after almonertinib resistance in 
      advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, which contributes to the limited body of literature
      examining ALK rearrangement as a mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs in advanced
      EGFR-mutant NSCLC. CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein, we present a 35-year-old female
      patient with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC in the last trimester of pregnancy. The
      patient was administered multiple treatments, including first-line icotinib and
      second-line almonertinib. According to the next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay
      after almonertinib resistance, the development of an EML4-ALK fusion mutation was
      considered to be a potential mechanism of almonertinib resistance. Subsequently, 
      the patient received a combination of almonertinib and crizotinib, and at the
      last follow-up, the treatment showed a curative effect and then maintained a
      one-month stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: This case report suggests that ALK
      rearrangement may be a potential mechanism of almonertinib resistance. The
      combination of ALK TKI therapy and EGFR TKI may be a viable strategy for
      almonertinib-resistant NSCLC patients induced by ALK rearrangement.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of biliary stenting alone versus stenting combined with
      iodine-125 seed strand implantation for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma with 
      malignant obstructive jaundice: a prospective, nonrandomized, controlled clinical
      study.
PG  - 2422-2431
LID - 10.21037/apm-22-676 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with cholangiocarcinoma also present with malignant
      obstructive jaundice (MOJ), which requires biliary drainage and stent placement. 
      Recently, clinicians have tried to implant iodine-125 seeds into the biliary
      tract. However, we know very little about this treatment. This study aimed to
      compare biliary stenting alone and stenting combined with iodine-125 seed strand 
      implantation to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this technique. METHODS:
      Sixty patients of cholangiocarcinoma with MOJ were enrolled into the study.
      According to voluntary choices, 30 received biliary stenting combined with
      iodine-125 seed strand implantation (study group), and 30 received biliary stent 
      implantation alone (control group). Various biochemical indicators and the
      manifestation of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      were compared before and after operation. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of
      these treatments by observing patients' symptoms, biochemical indicators and
      imaging data. Individualized antitumor therapy and regular follow-up were given
      according to the patients' condition. RESULTS: All 60 patients successfully
      completed operation. There were no statistically significant differences in
      baseline data between two groups (P>0.05). Before and 4 weeks after operation,
      the average total bilirubin levels decreased from 268.14+/-114.97 to
      54.00+/-80.78 micromol/L in study group, and decreased from 228.89+/-162.04 to
      58.80+/-61.14 micromol/L in control group. The difference between two groups was 
      not statistically significant (P=0.796). Before and 4 weeks after operation, the 
      average Child-Pugh scores decreased from 7.83+/-0.59 to 6.20+/-1.03 points in
      study group, and decreased from 7.93+/-1.08 to 7.07+/-1.39 points in control
      group, with a statistically significant difference between two groups (P=0.008). 
      The median patency time of stents was 41.71+/-3.46 weeks in study group and
      29.00+/-5.81 weeks in control group, with a statistically significant difference 
      between the two groups (P=0.037). A statistically significant difference in
      disease control rate (DCR) was observed between the two groups (P=0.045).
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated biliary stenting combined with iodine-125
      seed strand implantation may be consider as a safe treatment option for the
      patients of cholangiocarcinoma with MOJ, and this treatment may improve liver
      function, reduce the incidence of in-stent restenosis, and improve DCR.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of nanoparticle-albumin-bound paclitaxel compared with
      conventional taxanes in women with breast cancer: a systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 2382-2394
LID - 10.21037/apm-22-690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term benefit of nanoparticle-albumin-bound paclitaxel (Nab-P)
      over conventional taxanes in breast cancer patients is still controversial. We
      conducted a systematic review of studies to identify the optimal taxanes for
      selection in clinical practice. METHODS: We enrolled studies if they enrolled
      adults (age >/=18) with breast cancer, compared Nab-P (at any dose) to
      conventional paclitaxel or docetaxel, provided information on survival data, the 
      response rate, or adverse events, were randomized controlled trials, case-control
      studies, or cohort studies, and were published in English (including those
      published online, ahead of the print publication). Cochrane Collaboration tool
      and Newcastle-Ottawa scale were used for bias-risk assessment. Grading of
      recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation approach were adopted for
      the quality of evidence evaluation. The outcomes included the overall response
      rate, pathological complete response rate, progression-free survival, overall
      survival, allergic reaction, leukopenia, neutropenia, and sensory neuropathy.
      RESULTS: A total of 20 eligible clinical studies comprising 11,046 patients were 
      included in the analysis. No significant publication bias was observed based on a
      visual inspection of the funnel plots for progressionfree survival (PFS), and
      overall survival (OS). Compared to the conventional taxanes group (n=2,743), the 
      Nab-P group (n=1,680) had a significantly higher ORR (RR =1.21, 95% CI:
      1.07-1.37; P=0.003) and pCR (RR =1.33, 95% CI: 1.17-1.51; P<0.001). The Nab-P
      group also had a lower risk of disease progression and death than the
      conventional taxanes group (HR =0.89, P=0.269). Additionally, the Nab-P group had
      fewer treatment-related allergic reactions (RR =0.74, 95% CI: 0.59-0.93; P=0.009)
      and less grade >/=4 neutropenia (RR =0.39, 95% CI: 0.20-0.77; P=0.007) than the
      conventional taxanes group. The incidence of any-grade of neutropenia and sensory
      neuropathy were significantly higher in the Nab-P group than the conventional
      taxanes group (P=0.009 and P<0.001, respectively). DISCUSSION: The Nab-P in all
      stages of breast cancer patients had significantly better efficacy and tolerance 
      than the conventional taxanes. Moreover, preventive strategies for reducing the
      incidence of Nab-P induced sensory neuropathy should be explored in future
      studies.

TI  - Recent advances in conventional and unconventional vesicular secretion pathways
      in the tumor microenvironment.
PG  - 56
LID - 10.1186/s12929-022-00837-8 [doi]
AB  - All cells in the changing tumor microenvironment (TME) need a class of
      checkpoints to regulate the balance among exocytosis, endocytosis, recycling and 
      degradation. The vesicular trafficking and secretion pathways regulated by the
      small Rab GTPases and their effectors convey cell growth and migration signals
      and function as meditators of intercellular communication and molecular transfer.
      Recent advances suggest that Rab proteins govern conventional and unconventional 
      vesicular secretion pathways by trafficking widely diverse cargoes and substrates
      in remodeling TME. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of conventional and
      unconventional vesicular secretion pathways, their action modes and impacts on
      the cancer and stromal cells have been the focus of much attention for the past
      two decades. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of vesicular
      secretion pathways in TME. We begin with an overview of the structure,
      regulation, substrate recognition and subcellular localization of vesicular
      secretion pathways. We then systematically discuss how the three fundamental
      vesicular secretion processes respond to extracellular cues in TME. These
      processes are the conventional protein secretion via the endoplasmic
      reticulum-Golgi apparatus route and two types of unconventional protein secretion
      via extracellular vesicles and secretory autophagy. The latest advances and
      future directions in vesicular secretion-involved interplays between tumor cells,
      stromal cell and host immunity are also described.

TI  - Food group, macronutrient intake and metabolic status in the US-Affiliated
      Pacific's Children's Healthy Living (CHL) Program.
LID - nxac173 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxac173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Children's Healthy Living study provided dietary intake
      information for understudied Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (NHOPI)
      young children. OBJECTIVES: To describe food group and macronutrient intakes of
      NHOPI children in the US-affiliated Pacific region (USAP), overall and by
      jurisdiction, income level, and metabolic status. METHODS: 2-8 year olds (n =
      3520), were evaluated in a cross-sectional cluster sampled study using two days
      of dietary records completed by caregivers using provided tools, quantified by a 
      specially developed food composition table and compared to US dietary
      recommendations. Overweight and obesity (OWOB) and acanthosis nigricans (AN)
      assessment (metabolic status) was completed by trained evaluators using standard 
      tools. Demographic data were collected by questionnaire. Regression analysis
      identified differences in dietary component means by jurisdiction, World Bank
      income groups (WBIG) and metabolic status, adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Few
      children met US recommendations for vegetable (2.4%) and milk (4.1%) food groups.
      US macronutrient recommendations were generally met. Food group and macronutrient
      intakes were significantly different by jurisdiction and WBIG. Means for food
      groups, except meats, and macronutrients, except protein, were higher among
      overweight/obese (OWOB) compared to healthy weight children. Grain intake of 7.25
      (SE: 0.08) oz was higher (P<0.05) and milk intake of 0.90 (SE: 0.05) cups was
      lower (P<0.05) among children with OWOB compared to those without OWOB (grains:
      7.17 [SE: 0.07] oz and milk: 0.96 [SE: 0.04] cups). Monounsaturated fat intake of
      11.68 (SE: 0.10) % energy was higher among those with OWOB, compared to healthy
      weight children (11.56 [SE: 0.08] % energy, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Young
      children's diets in the USAP did not meet milk, vegetable or fruit intake
      recommendations. There was variability in dietary patterns across the USAP and by
      WBIG. Grain intake and monounsaturated fat intake was lower and milk intake was
      higher in children with better metabolic status.

TI  - Qualitative analysis of shared decision-making for chemoprevention in the primary
      care setting: provider-related barriers.
PG  - 208
LID - 10.1186/s12911-022-01954-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemoprevention with anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene or
      aromatase inhibitors, have been shown to reduce breast cancer risk in randomized 
      controlled trials; however, uptake among women at high-risk for developing breast
      cancer remains low. The aim of this study is to identify provider-related
      barriers to shared decision-making (SDM) for chemoprevention in the primary care 
      setting. METHODS: Primary care providers (PCPs) and high-risk women eligible for 
      chemoprevention were enrolled in a pilot study and a randomized clinical trial of
      web-based decision support tools to increase chemoprevention uptake. PCPs
      included internists, family practitioners, and gynecologists, whereas patients
      were high-risk women, age 35-75 years, who had a 5-year invasive breast cancer
      risk >/= 1.67%, according to the Gail model. Seven clinical encounters of
      high-risk women and their PCPs who were given access to these decision support
      tools were included in this study. Audio-recordings of the clinical encounters
      were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using grounded theory methodology.
      RESULTS: Six primary care providers, of which four were males (mean age 36 [SD
      6.5]) and two were females (mean age 39, [SD 11.5]) and seven racially/ethnically
      diverse high-risk female patients participated in this study. Qualitative
      analysis revealed three themes: (1) Competing demands during clinical encounters;
      (2) lack of knowledge among providers about chemoprevention; and (3) limited risk
      communication during clinical encounters. CONCLUSIONS: Critical barriers to SDM
      about chemoprevention were identified among PCPs. Providers need education and
      resources through decision support tools to engage in risk communication and SDM 
      with their high-risk patients, and to gain confidence in prescribing
      chemoprevention in the primary care setting.

TI  - Postprandial triglyceride levels rather than fat distribution may reflect early
      signs of disturbed fat metabolism in Iraqi immigrants.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/s12944-022-01679-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Previous studies have shown that at a similar body mass index, Middle
      Eastern immigrants are more insulin resistant and at higher risk for type 2
      diabetes (T2D) than native Europeans. Insulin resistance is strongly associated
      with disturbed fat metabolism and cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, fat
      metabolism is poorly investigated comparing Middle Eastern and European
      ethnicities. METHODS: This observational study included 26 Iraqi and 16
      Swedish-born men without T2D or clinical risk factors for CVD. An oral fat
      tolerance test (OFTT) was performed, where plasma triglycerides (p-TG) were
      measured for 6 h. mRNA expression and adipocyte size were measured in
      subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies collected prior to OFTT, and magnetic
      resonance imaging was conducted to assess body fat distribution. RESULTS: The
      median p-TG accumulation was higher and the clearance slower among Iraqis than
      Swedes. None of the groups reached their fasting p-TG (Iraqis 1.55 mmol/l; Swedes
      0.95 mmol/l) after 6 h (Iraqis p-TG 3.10 mmol/l; Swedes p-TG 1.50 mmol/l).
      Adipocyte size, mRNA expression, and fat accumulation in the liver, muscle and
      abdomen were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Postprandial p-TG levels rather 
      than fat distribution may reflect early signs of disturbed fat metabolism in
      Iraqi immigrants without CVD risk factors.

PG  - 331
LID - 10.1186/s12905-022-01916-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. This study aimed to share
      the results of the national cervical cancer screening program performed in
      primary health care institutions in Samsun between 2015 and 2019. METHODS: Women 
      aged 30-65 years who were screened for cervical cancer in screening centers of
      Samsun between January 01, 2015, and December 31, 2019, were included in this
      descriptive study. The data were obtained from the automation program of the
      "National Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) Laboratory Application" used by the
      Provincial Directorate of Health Cancer Unit through filtering the completion
      time of the tests, and all results were evaluated without sampling. Thus, data
      were presented using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The mean age of 89,302
      women included in the cervical cancer screening program was 45.9 +/- 9.0 years.
      Of the samples obtained from the participants, 1.0% were determined as
      insufficient material, 94.1% as HPV-negative, and 4.9% as HPV-positive. The most 
      common HPV genotypes were 16, 51, 31, and 52. Of the 4337 HPV-positive women,
      74.7% of the pap smear results were negative (including infection, 36.5%), and
      the most common premalignant lesions were atypical squamous cells of undetermined
      significance in 7.1% and low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in 6.9%. HPV 
      16/18 was also observed in 31.7% of HPV-positive women. Seven hundred ninety-five
      women were referred to a specialist physician for further examination and
      treatment within the scope of the screening algorithm. CONCLUSION: Detecting
      HPV-positivity by reaching more women within the national cervical cancer
      screening program's scope is vital in fighting against this disease. The
      effectiveness of cancer screening programs should be increased by ensuring
      community participation through awareness activities.

TI  - Propofol enhances stem-like properties of glioma via GABAAR-dependent Src
      modulation of ZDHHC5-EZH2 palmitoylation mechanism.
PG  - 398
LID - 10.1186/s13287-022-03087-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Propofol is a commonly used anesthetic. However, its effects on
      glioma growth and recurrence remain largely unknown. METHODS: The effect of
      propofol on glioma growth was demonstrated by a series of in vitro and in vivo
      experiments (spheroidal formation assay, western blotting, and xenograft model). 
      The acyl-biotin exchange method and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
      assays identified palmitoylation proteins mediated by the domain containing the
      Asp-His-His-Cys family. Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, quantitative
      real-time polymerase chain reaction, co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin
      immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter assays were used to explore the
      mechanisms of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR)/Src/ZDHHC5/EZH2
      signaling axis in the effects of propofol on glioma stem cells (GSCs). RESULTS:
      We found that treatment with a standard dose of propofol promoted glioma growth
      in nude mice compared with control or low-dose propofol. Propofol-treated GSCs
      also led to larger tumor growth in nude mice than did vector-treated tumors.
      Mechanistically, propofol enhances the stem-like properties of gliomas through
      GABAAR to increase Src expression, thereby enhancing the palmitoylation of
      ZDHHC5-mediated EZH2 and Oct4 expression. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate
      that propofol may promote glioma growth through the GABAAR-Src-ZDHHC5-EZH2
      mechanism and are helpful in guiding the clinical use of propofol to obtain a
      better patient prognosis after the surgical resection of tumors.

TI  - Neoadjuvant nivolumab + T-VEC combination therapy for resectable early stage or
      metastatic (IIIB-IVM1a) melanoma with injectable disease: study protocol of the
      NIVEC trial.
PG  - 851
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09896-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Trials investigating neoadjuvant treatment with immune checkpoint
      inhibitors (ICI) in patients with melanoma have shown high clinical and
      pathologic response rates. Treatment with talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), a
      modified herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), is approved for patients with
      unresectable stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma and has the potential to make tumors more 
      susceptible for ICI. Combination ICI and intralesional T-VEC has already been
      investigated in patients with unresectable stage IIIB-IV disease, however, no
      data is available yet on the potential benefit of this combination therapy in
      neoadjuvant setting. METHODS: This single center, single arm, phase II study aims
      to show an improved major pathologic complete response (pCR) rate, either pCR or 
      near-pCR, up to 45% in 24 patients with resectable stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma upon
      neoadjuvant combination treatment with intralesional T-VEC and systemic nivolumab
      (anti-PD-1 antibody). Patients will receive four courses of T-VEC up to 4 mL
      (first dose as seroconversion dose) and three doses of nivolumab (240 mg
      flatdose) every 2 weeks, followed by surgical resection in week nine. The primary
      endpoint of this trial is pathologic response rate. Secondary endpoints are
      safety, the rate of delay of surgery and event-free survival. Additionally,
      prognostic and predictive biomarker research and health-related quality of life
      evaluation will be performed. DISCUSSION: Intralesional T-VEC has the capacity to
      heighten the immune response and to elicit an abscopal effect in melanoma in
      combination with ICI. However, the potential clinical benefit of T-VEC plus ICI
      in the neoadjuvant setting remains unknown. This is the first trial investigating
      the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant treatment of T-VEC and nivolumab followed 
      by surgical resection in patients with stage IIIB-IVM1a melanoma, with the
      potential of high pathologic response rates and acceptable toxicity. TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in the European Union Drug Regulating
      Authorities Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT- number: 2019-001911-22 ) and the
      Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (NL71866.000.19) on 4th
      June 2020. Secondary identifying number: NCT04330430 .

TI  - Female breast cancer incidence predisposing risk factors identification using
      nationwide big data: a matched nested case-control study in Taiwan.
PG  - 849
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09913-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is an umbrella term referring to a group of
      biologically and molecularly heterogeneous diseases originating from the breast. 
      Globally, incidences of breast cancer has been increasing dramatically over the
      past decades. Analyses of multiple clinical "big data" can aid us in clarifying
      the means of preventing the disease. In addition, predisposing risk factors will 
      be the most important issues if we can confirm their relevance. This study aims
      to provide an overview of the predisposing factors that contribute to a higher
      possibility of developing breast cancer and emphasize the signs that we ought to 
      pay more attention to. METHODS: This is a matched nested case-control study. The 
      cohort focused on identifying the eligible risk factors in breast cancer
      development by data screening (2000-2013) from the Taiwan National Health
      Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) under approved protocol. A total of 486,069
      females were enrolled from a nationwide sampled database, and 3281 females was
      elligible as breast cancer cohort, 478,574 females who had never diagnosed with
      breast cancer from 2000 to 2013 were eligible as non-breast cancer controls, and 
      matched to breast cancer cases according to age using a 1:6 ratio. RESULTS: We
      analyzed 3281 breast cancer cases and 19,686 non-breast cancer controls after an 
      age-matched procedure. The significant predisposing factors associated with
      breast cancer development including obesity, hyperlipidemia, thyroid cancer and
      liver cancer. As for patients under the age of 55, gastric cancer does seem to
      have an impact on the development of breast cancer; compared with their
      counterparts over the age of 55, endometrial cancer appears to exhibit an
      evocative effect. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide matched nested case-control
      study, we identified obesity, hyperlipidemia, previous cancers of the thyroid,
      stomach and liver as risk factors associated with breast cancer. However, the
      retrospective nature and limited case numbers of certain cancers still difficult 
      to provide robust evidence. Further prospective studies are necessitated to
      corroborate this finding in order to nip the disease in the bud. TRIAL
      REGISTRATION: The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved
      by the China Medical University Hospital [CMUH104-REC2-115(AR-4)].

TI  - The clinical significance of integrin subunit alpha V in cancers: from small cell
      lung carcinoma to pan-cancer.
PG  - 300
LID - 10.1186/s12890-022-02095-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relationship between integrin subunit alpha
      V (ITGAV) and cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). METHODS: Using
      large sample size from multiple sources, the clinical roles of ITGAV expression
      in SCLC were explored using differential expression analysis, receiver operating 
      characteristic curves, Kaplan-Meier curves, etc. RESULTS: Decreased mRNA (SMD = -
      1.05) and increased protein levels of ITGAV were detected in SCLC (n = 865).
      Transcription factors-ZEB2, IK2F1, and EGR2-may regulate ITGAV expression in
      SCLC, as they had ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing)
      peaks upstream of the transcription start site of ITGAV. ITGAV expression made it
      feasible to distinguish SCLC from non-SCLC (AUC = 0.88, sensitivity = 0.78,
      specificity = 0.84), and represented a risk role in the prognosis of SCLC (p <
      0.05). ITGAV may play a role in cancers by influencing several immunity-related
      signaling pathways and immune cells. Further, the extensive pan-cancer analysis
      verified the differential expression of ITGAV and its clinical significance in
      multiple cancers. CONCLUSION: ITGAV served as a potential marker for prognosis
      and identification of cancers including SCLC.

TI  - Role of adipose tissue-derived cytokines in the progression of inflammatory
      breast cancer in patients with obesity.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s12944-022-01678-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) represents a deadly aggressive
      phenotype of breast cancer (BC) with a unique clinicopathological presentation
      and low survival rate. In fact, obesity represents an important risk factor for
      BC. Although several studies have identified different cellular-derived and
      molecular factors involved in IBC progression, the role of adipocytes remains
      unclear. Cancer-associated adipose tissue (CAAT) expresses a variety of
      adipokines, which contribute to tumorigenesis and the regulation of cancer stem
      cell (CSC). This research investigated the potential effect of the secretome of
      CAAT explants from patients with BC on the progression and metastasis of the
      disease. METHODS: This study established an ex-vivo culture of CAAT excised from 
      IBC (n = 13) vs. non-IBC (n = 31) patients with obesity and profiled their
      secretome using a cytokine antibody array. Furthermore, the quantitative PCR
      (qPCR) methodology was used to validate the levels of predominant cytokines at
      the transcript level after culture in a medium conditioned by CAAT. Moreover, the
      impact of the CAAT secretome on the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal
      transition (EMT) and cells with stem cell (CSC) markers was studied in the
      non-IBC MDA-MB-231 and the IBC SUM-149 cell lines. The statistical differences
      between variables were evaluated using the chi-squared test and unpaired a
      Student's t-test. RESULTS: The results of cytokine array profiling revealed an
      overall significantly higher level of a panel of 28 cytokines secreted by the
      CAAT ex-vivo culture from IBC patients with obesity compared to those with
      non-IBC. Of note, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte
      chemo-attractant protein 1 (MCP-1) were the major adipokines secreted by the CAAT
      IBC patients with obesity. Moreover, the qPCR results indicated a significant
      upregulation of the IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 mRNAs in CAAT ex-vivo culture of
      patients with IBC vs. those with non-IBC. Intriguingly, a qPCR data analysis
      showed that the CAAT secretome secretions from patients with non-IBC
      downregulated the mRNA levels of the CD24 CSC marker and of the epithelial marker
      E-cadherin in the non-IBC cell line. By contrast, E-cadherin was upregulated in
      the SUM-149 cell. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified the overexpression of IL-6, 
      IL-8, and MCP-1 as prognostic markers of CAAT from patients with IBC but not from
      those with non-IBC ; moreover, their upregulation might be associated with IBC
      aggressiveness via the regulation of CSC and EMT markers. This study proposed
      that targeting IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 may represent a therapeutic option that
      should be considered in the treatment of patients with IBC.

      primary liver cancer: a large prospective study.
PG  - 853
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09939-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and
      metabolic syndrome (MetS) are known to be associated with an increased incidence 
      of different cancers. We aimed to evaluate the effect of MetS combined with high 
      hs-CRP levels on the risk of primary liver cancer (PLC). METHODS: Participants
      were recruited from the Kailuan cohort study and were classified into four groups
      according to the presence or absence of MetS and inflammation (hs-CRP >/= 3 or < 
      3 mg/L). The associations of MetS and inflammation with the risk of PLC were
      assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: This study included
      92,770 participants. The mean age was 51.4 years old. Over a median follow-up of 
      13.02 years, 395 participants were diagnosed as PLC. Compared to the control
      participants without inflammation (hs-CRP < 3 mg/L) and MetS (n = 69,413),
      participants with high hs-CRP levels combined with MetS (n = 2,269) had a higher 
      risk of PLC [hazard ratios (HR) 2.91; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.77-4.81],
      and participants with high hs-CRP levels and without MetS (n = 14,576) had the
      same trend (HR, 1.36; 95%CI, 1.05-1.75). However, participants with low hs-CRP
      levels and MetS (n = 6,512) had no significant association with an elevated risk 
      of PLC (HR, 1.18; 95%CI, 0.76-1.82). After excluding participants who had cancer 
      during the first year of follow-up, sensitivity analysis showed the same trend.
      In addition, co-occurrence of MetS and high hs-CRP levels had significant
      interactive effects on the risk of PLC between the sexes (P < 0.001) and the
      patients with HBV infection (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Participants with
      co-occurrence of MetS and high hs-CRP levels have an elevated risk of PLC. TRIAL

AB  - Tumor acidosis, a common phenomenon in solid cancers such as breast cancer, is
      caused by the abnormal metabolism of cancer cells. The low pH affects cells
      surrounding the cancer, and tumor acidosis has been shown to inhibit the activity
      of immune cells. Despite many previous studies, the immune surveillance
      mechanisms are not fully understood. We found that the expression of PD-L1 was
      significantly increased under conditions of extracellular acidosis in MDA-MB-231 
      cells. We also confirmed that the increased expression of PD-L1 mediated by
      extracellular acidosis was decreased when the pH was raised to the normal range. 
      Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of public breast cancer patient databases
      showed that PD-L1 expression was also highly correlated with IL-6/JAK/STAT3
      signaling. Surprisingly, the expression of both phospho-tyrosine STAT3 and PD-L1 
      was significantly increased under conditions of extracellular acidosis, and
      inhibition of STAT3 did not increase the expression of PD-L1 even under acidic
      conditions in MDA-MB-231 cells. Based on these results, we suggest that the
      expression of PD-L1 is increased by tumor acidosis via activation of STAT3 in
      MDA-MB-231 cells.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency hospital cancer admissions in a UK
      region.
PG  - 850
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09932-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pandemic disrupted society and health services through lockdowns 
      and resource reallocation to care for COVID-19 patients. Reductions in numbers of
      cancer patients having surgery, being diagnosed pathologically or via 2-week
      wait, and screening programs pauses have been described. The effect on emergency 
      presentation, which represents an acute episode with poor outcomes, has not been 
      investigated. This study explored the pandemic's impact on emergency hospital
      admissions for cancer patients in a UK region. METHODS: Hospital discharge data
      for cancer patients in Northern Ireland, which included route to admission, were 
      analysed for the pandemic era in 2020 compared to averages for March to December 
      2017-2019, focusing on volume and route of emergency admissions by demography and
      tumour site. FINDINGS: Compared with the pre-pandemic era, the number of cancer
      emergency admissions fell by 12.3% in 2020. Emergency admissions for cancer were 
      significantly reduced when COVID-19 levels were highest (- 18.5% in April and -
      16.8% in October). Females (- 15.8%), urban residents (- 13.2%), and age groups 0
      to 49 and 65-74 years old (- 17%) experienced the largest decreases as did those 
      with haematological (- 14.7%), brain and CNS (- 27.9%), and lung cancers(-
      14.3%). Significant reductions in referrals from outpatient departments (- 51%)
      and primary care (- 43%) (p < 0.001) were counterbalanced by admissions from
      other routes including confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection (increase
      83.6%). INTERPRETATION: Reductions in emergency admissions, and pathologically
      diagnosed cancers, as reported by the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR),
      indicate undiagnosed patients in the community which has implications for future 
      workloads and survival. Data suggest undiagnosed cases may be higher for
      haematological, brain and CNS, and lung cancers and among females. Efforts should
      be made to encourage people with symptoms to present for diagnosis or
      reassurance. FUNDING: The NICR is funded by the Public Health Agency of Northern 
      Ireland. This work was supported by Macmillan Cancer Support and uses data
      collected by health services as part of their care and support functions.

TI  - Establishment and characterization of NCC-MRT1-C1: a novel cell line of malignant
      rhabdoid tumor.
LID - 10.1007/s13577-022-00751-z [doi]
AB  - Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a sarcoma histologically characterized by
      rhabdoid cells and genetically characterized by loss of function of the chromatin
      remodeling complex SWI/SNF induced by SMARCB1 gene deficiency. MRT mainly occurs 
      in children, may arise in various locations, but is predominantly in the central 
      nervous system (CNS) and kidney. Although MRT exhibits poor prognosis, standard
      treatment has not yet been established due to its extreme rarity. Patient-derived
      cancer cell lines are critical tools for basic and pre-clinical research in the
      development of chemotherapy. However, none of the MRT cell lines was derived from
      adult patients, and only one cell line was derived from the MRT of a soft tissue,
      despite the clinical behavior of MRT varying according to patient age and
      anatomic site. Herein, we reported the first cell line of MRT isolated from the
      soft tissue of an adult patient and named it NCC-MRT1-C1. NCC-MRT1-C1 cells
      showed a biallelic loss of the SMARCB1 gene. NCC-MRT1-C1 cells demonstrated rapid
      proliferation, spheroid formation, invasion capability in vitro, and
      tumorigenesis in nude mice. Screening of antitumor agents in NCC-MRT1-C1 cells
      resulted in the identification of six effective drugs. In conclusion, we report
      the first MRT cell line from the soft tissue of an adult patient. We believe that
      NCC-MRT1-C1 is a useful tool for developing novel chemotherapies for MRT.

TI  - Optimized process quality in certified breast centers through adherence to
      stringent diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms effects of structural as well as 
      socio-demographic factors on start of therapy.
LID - 10.1007/s00404-022-06666-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: An increasing incidence of breast cancer can be observed worldwide.
      Since a delay of therapy can have a negative impact on prognosis, timely cancer
      care is an important quality indicator. By receiving treatment at a certified
      breast cancer center, the patient has the best chance of treatment in accordance 
      with guidelines and the best prognosis. The identification of risk factors for a 
      delay of therapy is of central importance and should be the basis for a
      continuous optimization of treatment at breast cancer centers. METHODS: This
      retrospective study included women with breast cancer (primary diagnosis,
      relapse, or secondary malignancy) at the University Hospital Wurzburg in 2019 and
      2020. Data were retrieved from patients' records. Correlations and regression
      analyses were performed to detect potential risk factors for treatment delay.
      RESULTS: Patients who received the histological confirmation of breast cancer at 
      an external institution experienced a later therapy start than those patients who
      received the histological confirmation at the University Hospital Wurzburg
      itself. (35.7 vs. 32.2 days). The interval between histological confirmation and 
      the first consultation at the University Hospital Wurzburg correlated
      statistically significant with age, distress and distance to the hospital.
      CONCLUSION: Patients with an in-house diagnosis of breast cancer are treated more
      quickly than those whose diagnosis was confirmed in an external institution. We
      identified factors such as increased age, greater distance to the hospital as
      well as increased distress to prolong the time until start of oncological
      treatment. Intensified patient care should be offered to these subgroups.

TI  - The prognostic implications of SIRTs expression in breast cancer: a systematic
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 69
LID - 10.1007/s12672-022-00529-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sirtuins (SIRTs) have key roles in cancer progression. However, the
      prognostic implications of SIRTs in breast cancer (BC) remains a subject of
      debate and controversy. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to identify the
      precise prognostic value of SIRTs in BC patients. METHODS: Systematic literature 
      searching was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase
      databases. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
      were calculated to estimate the association of SIRTs expression and survival
      outcomes in BC patients. RESULTS: A total of 22 original studies with 6317
      patients were eligible for this meta-analysis. The results showed that in
      patients with BC, elevated SIRTs levels were associated with shorter overall
      survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) both in univariate (HR = 1.56, 95% 
      CI 1.21-2.00; HR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.32-2.12, respectively) and multivariate
      analysis models (HR = 2.11, 95% CI 1.48-3.00; HR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.20-2.39,
      respectively). Notably, further subgroup analysis revealed that overexpression of
      SIRT1 and SIRT6 predicted poor OS (HR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.54-4.56; HR = 2.53, 95% CI
      1.64-3.90, respectively) and DFS (HR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.07-2.56; HR = 2.74; 95% CI 
      1.88-4.01, respectively) in BC. CONCLUSIONS: Our data has elucidated that SIRT1
      and SIRT6 could serve as prognostic biomarkers for patients with BC and may
      contribute to refined patient management.

TI  - Development of an adverse outcome pathway network for breast cancer: a
      comprehensive representation of the pathogenesis, complexity and diversity of the
      disease.
LID - 10.1007/s00204-022-03351-w [doi]
AB  - Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), introduced in modern toxicology, intend to
      provide an evidence-based representation of toxicological effects and facilitate 
      safety assessment of chemicals not solely based on laboratory animal in vivo
      experiments. However, some toxicological processes are too complicated to
      represent in one AOP. Therefore, AOP networks are developed that help
      understanding and predicting toxicological processes where complex exposure
      scenarios interact and lead to the emergence of the adverse outcome. In this
      study, we present an AOP network for breast cancer, developed after an in-depth
      survey of relevant scientific literature. Several molecular initiating events
      (MIE) were identified and various key events that link the MIEs with breast
      cancer were described. The AOP was developed according to Organization of
      Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) guidance, weight of evidence was
      assessed through the Bradford Hill criteria and confidence was tested by the OECD
      key questions. The AOP network provides a straightforward understanding of the
      disease onset and progression at different biological levels. It can be used to
      pinpoint knowledge gaps, identify novel therapeutic targets and act as a stepping
      stone for the development of novel in vitro test methods for hazard
      identification and risk assessment of newly developed chemicals and drugs.

TI  - Functional connectivity in reward circuitry and symptoms of anhedonia as
      therapeutic targets in depression with high inflammation: evidence from a
      dopamine challenge study.
LID - 10.1038/s41380-022-01715-3 [doi]
AB  - Increased inflammation in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been associated
      with low functional connectivity (FC) in corticostriatal reward circuits and
      symptoms of anhedonia, relationships which may involve the impact of inflammation
      on synthesis and release of dopamine. To test this hypothesis while establishing 
      a platform to examine target engagement of potential therapies in patients with
      increased inflammation, medically stable unmedicated adult MDD outpatients
      enrolled to have a range of inflammation (as indexed by plasma C-reactive protein
      [CRP] levels) were studied at two visits involving acute challenge with the
      dopamine precursor levodopa (L-DOPA; 250 mg) and placebo (double-blind,
      randomized order ~1-week apart). The primary outcome of resting-state (rs)FC in a
      classic ventral striatum to ventromedial prefrontal cortex reward circuit was
      calculated using a targeted, a priori approach. Data available both pre- and
      post-challenge (n = 31/40) established stability of rsFC across visits and
      determined CRP > 2 mg/L as a cut-point for patients exhibiting positive FC
      responses (post minus pre) to L-DOPA versus placebo (p < 0.01). Higher
      post-L-DOPA FC in patients with CRP > 2 mg/L was confirmed in all patients (n =
      40) where rsFC data were available post-challenge (B = 0.15, p = 0.006), and in
      those with task-based (tb)FC during reward anticipation (B = 0.15, p = 0.013).
      While effort-based motivation outside the scanner positively correlated with rsFC
      independent of treatment or CRP, change in anhedonia scores negatively correlated
      with rsFC after L-DOPA only in patients with CRP > 2 mg/L (r = -0.56, p = 0.012).
      FC in reward circuitry should be further validated in larger samples as a
      biomarker of target engagement for potential treatments including dopaminergic
      agents in MDD patients with increased inflammation.

AB  - Patients with neuroendocrine tumors of gastro-entero-pancreatic origin (GEP-NET) 
      experience changes in fat and muscle composition. Dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) are currently
      used to analyze body composition. Changes thereof could indicate cancer
      progression or response to treatment. This study examines the correlation between
      CT-based (computed tomography) body composition analysis (BCA) and DXA or BIA
      measurement. 74 GEP-NET-patients received whole-body [68Ga]-DOTATOC-PET/CT, BIA, 
      and DXA-scans. BCA was performed based on the non-contrast-enhanced, 5 mm,
      whole-body-CT images. BCA from CT shows a strong correlation between body fat
      ratio with DXA (r = 0.95, rhoC = 0.83) and BIA (r = 0.92, rhoC = 0.76) and
      between skeletal muscle ratio with BIA: r = 0.81, rhoC = 0.49. The deep
      learning-network achieves highly accurate results (mean Sorensen-Dice-score
      0.93). Using BCA on routine Positron emission tomography/CT-scans to monitor
      patients' body composition in the diagnostic workflow can reduce additional exams
      whilst substantially amplifying measurement in slower progressing cancers such as
      GEP-NET.

TI  - Predicting liver regeneration following major resection.
PG  - 13396

AB  - Breakdown of synthesis, excretion and detoxification defines liver failure.
      Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is specific for liver resection and a
      rightfully feared complication due to high lethality and limited therapeutic
      success. Individual cytokine and growth factor profiles may represent potent
      predictive markers for recovery of liver function. We aimed to investigate these 
      profiles in post-hepatectomy regeneration. This study combined a time-dependent
      cytokine and growth factor profiling dataset of a training (30 patients) and a
      validation (14 patients) cohorts undergoing major liver resection with
      statistical and predictive models identifying individual pathway signatures. 2319
      associations were tested. Primary hepatocytes isolated from patient tissue
      samples were stimulated and their proliferation was analysed through DNA content 
      assay. Common expression trajectories of cytokines and growth factors with strong
      correlation to PHLF, morbidity and mortality were identified despite highly
      individual perioperative dynamics. Especially, dynamics of EGF, HGF, and PLGF
      were associated with mortality. PLGF was additionally associated with PHLF and
      complications. A global association-network was calculated and validated to
      investigate interdependence of cytokines and growth factors with clinical
      attributes. Preoperative cytokine and growth factor signatures were identified
      allowing prediction of mortality following major liver resection by regression
      modelling. Proliferation analysis of corresponding primary human hepatocytes
      showed associations of individual regenerative potential with clinical outcome.
      Prediction of PHLF was possible on as early as first postoperative day (POD1)
      with AUC above 0.75. Prediction of PHLF and mortality is possible on POD1 with
      liquid-biopsy based risk profiling. Further utilization of these models would
      allow tailoring of interventional strategies according to individual profiles.

TI  - Exploring Patients' Understanding of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy.
LID - 10.1007/s13187-022-02206-3 [doi]
AB  - Little quantitative evidence exists surrounding patients' level of understanding 
      of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) symptoms (numbness,
      tingling, pain in the hands/feet) and consequences (e.g., negatively affect
      physical functioning or chemotherapy dosing) at the beginning of chemotherapy.
      The purpose of this cross-sectional, secondary analysis was to describe CIPN
      knowledge and education patterns among adults early in a course of neurotoxic
      chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer (< three infusions). Following consent, 
      participants completed an electronic questionnaire about their perceptions of
      CIPN symptoms, incidence, and education. Participants (N = 92) were mainly female
      (76%), white (91%), and diagnosed with breast (46%) or gastrointestinal (40%)
      cancers. Most participants without CIPN (n = 48) did not expect to develop CIPN
      (45%) or were unaware of CIPN as a side-effect (30%). Furthermore, 71% of
      participants without CIPN (n = 31) estimated CIPN to occur in </= 30% of patients
      receiving neurotoxic chemotherapy. Overall, participants learned about CIPN from 
      their doctor or nurse prior to beginning chemotherapy (90%). Clinicians delivered
      education about CIPN symptoms (75%), but less frequently delivered education
      about CIPN management (14%), or the impact of CIPN on the ability to continue
      chemotherapy (16%) or physical functioning (24%). Finally, participants reported 
      that a discussion with their doctor/nurse would be the best way to learn about
      CIPN (92%). Results revealed that participants without CIPN were largely unaware 
      of the adverse consequences or incidence of CIPN during treatment. Further
      research is needed to investigate optimal methods to promote patient-clinician
      communication about CIPN during chemotherapy to enhance patients' retention of
      CIPN information and activation in their care.

TI  - Redefining the role of surgery in early small-cell lung cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s00423-022-02631-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Resection is guideline recommended in stage I small-cell lung cancer
      (SCLC) but not in stage II. In this stage, patients are treated with a
      non-surgical approach. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the role of
      surgery in both SCLC stages. Surgically treated patients were compared to
      non-surgical controls. Five-year survival rates were analysed. METHODS: A
      systematic literature search was performed on December 01, 2021 in Medline,
      Embase and Cochrane Library. Studies published since 2004 on the effect of
      surgery in SCLC were considered and assessed using ROBINS-I. We preformed
      I(2)-tests, Q-statistics, DerSimonian-Laird tests and Egger-regression. The
      meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA. RESULTS: Out of 6826 records, we
      identified seven original studies with a total of 15,170 patients that met our
      inclusion criteria. We found heterogeneity between these studies and ruled out
      any publication bias. Patient characteristics did not significantly differ
      between the two groups (p-value > 0.05). The 5-year survival rates in stage I
      were 47.4 +/- 11.6% for the 'surgery group' and 21.7 +/- 11.3% for the
      'non-surgery group' (p-value = 0.0006). Our analysis of stage II SCLC revealed a 
      significant survival benefit after surgery (40.2 +/- 21.6% versus 21.2 +/- 17.3%;
      p-value = 0.0474). CONCLUSION: Based on our data, the role of surgery in stage I 
      and II SCLC is robust, since it improves the long-term survival in both stages
      significantly. Hence, feasibility of surgery as a priority treatment should
      always be evaluated not only in stage I SCLC but also in stage II, for which
      guideline recommendations might have to be reassessed.

TI  - Technical Report: Diagnosis and Management of Hyperbilirubinemia in the Newborn
      Infant 35 or More Weeks of Gestation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Severe hyperbilirubinemia is associated with kernicterus. Informed
      guidance on hyperbilirubinemia management, including preventive treatment
      thresholds, is essential to safely minimize neurodevelopmental risk. OBJECTIVE:
      To update the evidence base necessary to develop the 2022 American Academy of
      Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for management of hyperbilirubinemia in
      the newborn infant >/=35 weeks' gestation. DATA SOURCE: PubMed. STUDY SELECTION: 
      English language randomized controlled trials and observational studies.
      Excluded: case reports or series, nonsystematic reviews, and investigations
      focused on <35-weeks' gestation infants. DATA EXTRACTION: Topics addressed in the
      previous clinical practice guideline (2004) and follow-up commentary (2009) were 
      updated with new evidence published through March 2022. Evidence reviews were
      conducted for previously unaddressed topics (phototherapy-associated adverse
      effects and effectiveness of intravenous immune globulin [IVIG] to prevent
      exchange transfusion). RESULTS: New evidence indicates that neurotoxicity does
      not occur until bilirubin concentrations are well above the 2004 exchange
      transfusion thresholds. Systematic review of phototherapy-associated adverse
      effects found limited and/or inconsistent evidence of late adverse effects,
      including cancer and epilepsy. IVIG has unclear benefit for preventing exchange
      transfusion in infants with isoimmune hemolytic disease, with a possible risk of 
      harm due to necrotizing enterocolitis. LIMITATIONS: The search was limited to 1
      database and English language studies. CONCLUSIONS: Accumulated evidence
      justified narrowly raising phototherapy treatment thresholds in the updated
      clinical practice guideline. Limited evidence for effectiveness with some
      evidence of risk of harm support the revised recommendations to limit IVIG use.

TI  - Direct-to-Implant Breast Reconstruction After Unilateral and Bilateral
      Mastectomy: Cross-Sectional Study of Patient Satisfaction and Quality of Life
      with BREAST-Q.
LID - 10.1007/s00266-022-02986-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Immediate single stage breast reconstruction is a challenging
      procedure with the goal of improving the quality of life of patients with breast 
      cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate using the BREAST-Q patient
      satisfaction, body perception and quality of life after direct-to-implant breast 
      reconstruction comparing unilateral and bilateral reconstructions. METHODS: In
      this study we enrolled 56 women who underwent mastectomy and immediate
      single-stage direct-to-implant (DTI) breast reconstruction at Campus Bio-Medico
      University of Rome between 2013 and 2020. One year after surgery they were
      administered electronically the BREAST-Q post-operative module. RESULTS: Our two 
      cohorts of patients consisted in 34 women who received unilateral nipple-sparing 
      mastectomy and DTI breast reconstruction and 22 women who underwent bilateral
      nipple-sparing mastectomy and DTI breast reconstruction. Twenty-four of the 34
      patients belonging to the unilateral group responded to the questionnaire
      (70.5%), while in the bilateral group responders were 16 out of 22 (72.7%). The
      BREAST-Q scores were compared between the two groups: patients undergoing
      bilateral mastectomy and breast reconstruction showed higher scores in every
      BREAST-Q domain compared to patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy and breast 
      reconstruction with a statistically significant difference in the Satisfaction
      with breast (P = 0.01), Sexual well-being (P = 0.03), and Satisfaction with
      implants (P = 0.01) domains. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing bilateral DTI
      breast reconstruction have a favorable postoperative surgical cosmetic outcome
      with a better patient's body image perception and a higher post-operative level
      of satisfaction compared to unilateral DTI reconstruction after nipple-sparing
      mastectomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a

TI  - Age and Breast Reconstruction.
LID - 10.1007/s00266-022-03024-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast reconstruction is frequently offered to cancer patients who
      undergo mastectomy. Older women tend to have lower rates of reconstruction mostly
      due to an age-based discretion. We aimed to assess the safety of this surgery in 
      this population. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of 
      patients who underwent breast reconstruction following mastectomy between 2015
      and 2020 at "Complejo Hospitalario Universitario de Albacete." Patients were
      classified according to age when the reconstruction process began (group A: < 65 
      years-group B: > 65 years). Differences in demographics and clinical data were
      analyzed using Student's t test and Chi-square test. Multivariable logistic
      regression models were used to estimate odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals 
      (CIs) for surgical complications according to age group. Propensity-score
      matching was used as a sensitivity analysis to test consistency among results.
      RESULTS: We included 304 women (266: group A-38: group B). Complete
      reconstruction was achieved in 48.1% of patients in group A vs 10.5% in group B
      (P < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, age was not associated
      with an increased risk of surgical complications, neither overall (OR 0.88, 95%CI
      0.40-1.95), early (OR 1.35, 95%CI 0.58-3.13) nor late (OR 1.05, 95%CI 0.40-2.81).
      Radiotherapy and smoking history were significant predictors for complications in
      every setting. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, age at breast reconstruction is not
      associated with a higher risk of surgical complications, in contrast to
      radiotherapy and smoking history. Therefore, age should not be a limiting factor 
      when considering breast reconstruction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal
      requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article. For a full
      description of these Evidence-Based Medicine ratings, please refer to the Table

TI  - Molecular map of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its impact on outcome.
LID - 10.1038/s41588-022-01140-w [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in cancer characterization have consistently revealed marked
      heterogeneity, impeding the completion of integrated molecular and clinical maps 
      for each malignancy. Here, we focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a B
      cell neoplasm with variable natural history that is conventionally categorized
      into two subtypes distinguished by extent of somatic mutations in the heavy-chain
      variable region of immunoglobulin genes (IGHV). To build the 'CLL map,' we
      integrated genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data from 1,148 patients. We
      identified 202 candidate genetic drivers of CLL (109 new) and refined the
      characterization of IGHV subtypes, which revealed distinct genomic landscapes and
      leukemogenic trajectories. Discovery of new gene expression subtypes further
      subcategorized this neoplasm and proved to be independent prognostic factors.
      Clinical outcomes were associated with a combination of genetic, epigenetic and
      gene expression features, further advancing our prognostic paradigm. Overall,
      this work reveals fresh insights into CLL oncogenesis and prognostication.

AB  - During the investigation, soil actinomycetes were isolated from Kathlekanu swamp 
      forest and the crude ethyl acetate extract from the potent isolate KF15 was
      analysed with GC-MS and HPTLC to identify bioactive metabolites. The crude
      extract was examined for in-vitro antifungal activity on pathogens of chilli; MTT
      cytotoxicity assay was performed against HeLa cell line to determine the
      anticancer potential. The isolate Streptomyces sp. strain KF15 exhibited
      antagonistic activity against fungal pathogens by inhibiting growth and altering 
      growth pattern with increased antimicrobial activity in dose-dependent manner.
      GC-MS revealed many bioactive compounds and HPTLC depicted metabolite
      fingerprint. The IC50 of 99.85 microg/ml indicated the high potential of KF15
      extract to prevent proliferation of HeLa cells. Therefore, the findings of this
      study indicate that the crude extract from Streptomyces sp. strain KF15 contains 
      antifungal and anticancer metabolites; further study on purification could help
      in controlling many fungal diseases as well as cervical cancer in humans.

AB  - DNA-protein interactions mediate physiologic gene regulation and may be altered
      by DNA variants linked to polygenic disease. To enhance the speed and
      signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the identification and quantification of proteins 
      associated with specific DNA sequences in living cells, we developed proximal
      biotinylation by episomal recruitment (PROBER). PROBER uses high-copy episomes to
      amplify SNR, and proximity proteomics (BioID) to identify the transcription
      factors and additional gene regulators associated with short DNA sequences of
      interest. PROBER quantified both constitutive and inducible association of
      transcription factors and corresponding chromatin regulators to target DNA
      sequences and binding quantitative trait loci due to single-nucleotide variants. 
      PROBER identified alterations in regulator associations due to cancer hotspot
      mutations in the hTERT promoter, indicating that these mutations increase
      promoter association with specific gene activators. PROBER provides an approach
      to rapidly identify proteins associated with specific DNA sequences and their
      variants in living cells.

TI  - Sprod for de-noising spatially resolved transcriptomics data based on position
      and image information.
PG  - 950-958
LID - 10.1038/s41592-022-01560-w [doi]
AB  - Spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) provide gene expression close to, or
      even superior to, single-cell resolution while retaining the physical locations
      of sequencing and often also providing matched pathology images. However, SRT
      expression data suffer from high noise levels, due to the shallow coverage in
      each sequencing unit and the extra experimental steps required to preserve the
      locations of sequencing. Fortunately, such noise can be removed by leveraging
      information from the physical locations of sequencing, and the tissue
      organization reflected in corresponding pathology images. In this work, we
      developed Sprod, based on latent graph learning of matched location and imaging
      data, to impute accurate SRT gene expression. We validated Sprod comprehensively 
      and demonstrated its advantages over previous methods for removing drop-outs in
      single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We showed that, after imputation by Sprod,
      differential expression analyses, pathway enrichment and cell-to-cell interaction
      inferences are more accurate. Overall, we envision de-noising by Sprod to become 
      a key first step towards empowering SRT technologies for biomedical discoveries.

TI  - Length of biliopancreatic limb in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and its impact on
      post-operative outcomes in metabolic and obesity surgery-systematic review and
      meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a gold-standard procedure for
      treatment of obesity and associated comorbidities. No consensus on the optimal
      design of this operation has been achieved, with various lengths of bypassed
      small bowel limb lengths being used by bariatric surgeons. This aim of this
      systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether biliopancreatic limb
      (BPL) length in RYGB affects postoperative outcomes including superior reduction 
      in weight, body mass index (BMI), and resolution of metabolic comorbidities
      associated with obesity. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was
      conducted up until 1st June 2021. Meta-analysis of primary outcomes was performed
      utilising a random-effects model. Statistical significance was determined by p
      value < 0.05. RESULTS: Ten randomised controlled trials were included in the
      final quantitative analysis. No difference in outcomes following short versus
      long BLP in RYGB was identified at 12-72 months post-operatively, namely in BMI
      reduction, remission or improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
      dyslipidaemia, and complications (p > 0.05). Even though results of four studies 
      showed superior total body weight loss in the long BPL cohorts at 24 months
      post-operatively (pooled mean difference -6.92, 95% CI -12.37, -1.48, p = 0.01), 
      this outcome was not observed at any other timepoint. CONCLUSION: Based on the
      outcomes of the present study, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that
      alteration of the BPL affects the quantity of weight loss or resolution of
      co-existent metabolic comorbidities associated with obesity.

TI  - Quantitative CT evaluation after two cycles of induction chemotherapy to predict 
      prognosis of patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      before undergoing definitive chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy.
LID - 10.1007/s00330-022-08994-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the performance of quantitative CT analysis in
      predicting the prognosis of patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma (ESCC) after two cycles of induction chemotherapy before
      definitive chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy. METHODS: A total of 110 patients with 
      locally advanced ESCC were retrospectively analysed. Baseline chest CT and CT
      after two cycles of induction chemotherapy were analysed. A multivariate Cox
      proportional-hazard regression model was used to identify independent prognostic 
      markers for survival analysis. Then, a CT scoring system was established.
      Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the
      Kaplan-Meier method were employed for analysing the prognostic value of the CT
      scoring system. RESULTS: Body mass index, treatment strategy, change ratios of
      thickness (DeltaTHmax), CT value of the primary tumour (DeltaCTVaxial) and the
      short diameter (DeltaSD-LN), and the presence of an enlarged small lymph node
      (ESLN) after two cycles of chemotherapy were noted as independent factors for
      predicting overall survival (OS). The specificity of the presence of ESLN for
      death after 12 months was up to 100%. Areas under the curve value of the CT
      scoring system for predicting OS and progression-free survival (PFS) were higher 
      than that of the RECIST (p < 0.05). Responders had significantly longer OS and
      PFS than non-responders. CONCLUSION: Quantitative CT analysis after two cycles of
      induction chemotherapy could predict the outcome of locally advanced ESCC
      patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy. The CT scoring
      system could contribute to the development of an appropriate strategy for
      patients with locally advanced ESCC. KEY POINTS: * Quantitative CT evaluation
      after two cycles of induction chemotherapy can predict the long-term outcome of
      locally advanced oesophageal cancer treated with definitive
      chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy. * A CT scoring system provides valuable imaging
      support for indicating the prognosis at the early stage of therapy. *
      Quantitative CT evaluation can assist clinicians in personalising treatment
      plans.

TI  - METTL3 preferentially enhances non-m(6)A translation of epigenetic factors and
      promotes tumourigenesis.
LID - 10.1038/s41556-022-00968-y [doi]
AB  - METTL3 encodes the predominant catalytic enzyme to promote m(6)A methylation in
      nucleus. Recently, accumulating evidence has shown the expression of METTL3 in
      cytoplasm, but its function is not fully understood. Here we demonstrated an
      m(6)A-independent mechanism for METTL3 to promote tumour progression. In gastric 
      cancer, METTL3 could not only facilitate cancer progression via m(6)A
      modification, but also bind to numerous non-m(6)A-modified mRNAs, suggesting an
      unexpected role of METTL3. Mechanistically, cytoplasm-anchored METTL3 interacted 
      with PABPC1 to stabilize its association with cap-binding complex eIF4F, which
      preferentially promoted the translation of epigenetic factors without m(6)A
      modification. Clinical investigation showed that cytoplasmic distributed METTL3
      was highly correlated with gastric cancer progression, and this finding could be 
      expanded to prostate cancer. Therefore, the cytoplasmic METTL3 enhances the
      translation of epigenetic mRNAs, thus serving as an oncogenic driver in cancer
      progression, and METTL3 subcellular distribution can assist diagnosis and predict
      prognosis for patients with cancer.

TI  - Nucleotide imbalance decouples cell growth from cell proliferation.
LID - 10.1038/s41556-022-00965-1 [doi]
AB  - Nucleotide metabolism supports RNA synthesis and DNA replication to enable cell
      growth and division. Nucleotide depletion can inhibit cell growth and
      proliferation, but how cells sense and respond to changes in the relative levels 
      of individual nucleotides is unclear. Moreover, the nucleotide requirement for
      biomass production changes over the course of the cell cycle, and how cells
      coordinate differential nucleotide demands with cell cycle progression is not
      well understood. Here we find that excess levels of individual nucleotides can
      inhibit proliferation by disrupting the relative levels of nucleotide bases
      needed for DNA replication and impeding DNA replication. The resulting purine and
      pyrimidine imbalances are not sensed by canonical growth regulatory pathways like
      mTORC1, Akt and AMPK signalling cascades, causing excessive cell growth despite
      inhibited proliferation. Instead, cells rely on replication stress signalling to 
      survive during, and recover from, nucleotide imbalance during S phase. We find
      that ATR-dependent replication stress signalling is activated during unperturbed 
      S phases and promotes nucleotide availability to support DNA replication.
      Together, these data reveal that imbalanced nucleotide levels are not detected
      until S phase, rendering cells reliant on replication stress signalling to cope
      with this metabolic problem and disrupting the coordination of cell growth and
      division.

TI  - Nuclear beta-catenin translocation plays a key role in osteoblast differentiation
      of giant cell tumor of bone.
PG  - 13438
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17728-5 [doi]
AB  - Denosumab is a game-changing drug for giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB); however,
      its clinical biomarker regarding tumor ossification of GCTB has not been
      elucidated. In this study, we investigated the relationship between
      Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and the ossification of GCTB and evaluated whether
      endogenous nuclear beta-catenin expression predicted denosumab-induced bone
      formation in GCTB. Genuine patient-derived primary GCTB tumor stromal cells
      exhibited osteoblastic characteristics. Identified osteoblastic markers and
      nuclear beta-catenin translocation were significantly upregulated via
      differentiation induction and were inhibited by treating with Wnt signaling
      inhibitor, GGTI-286, or selective Rac1-LEF inhibitor, NSC23766. Furthermore, we
      reviewed the endogenous ossification and nuclear beta-catenin translocation of 86
      GCTB clinical samples and elucidated that intra-tumoral ossification was
      significantly associated with the nuclear translocation. Three-dimensional
      quantitative analyses (n = 13) of tumoral CT images have revealed that the
      nuclear beta-catenin translocation of naive GCTB samples was significantly
      involved with the denosumab-induced tumor ossification. Our findings suggest a
      close relationship between the nuclear beta-catenin translocation and the
      osteoblastic differentiation of GCTB. Investigations of the nuclear beta-catenin 
      in naive GCTB samples may provide a promising biomarker for predicting the
      ossification of GCTB following denosumab treatment.

TI  - Identification of differentially expressed microRNAs as potential biomarkers for 
      carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma.
PG  - 13383
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17740-9 [doi]
AB  - Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA) is a rare malignancy that transforms from
      PA. Early detection of the carcinoma by biopsy is difficult due to similar
      histopathology of the malignant and benign components. To address this, we
      investigated and compared the characteristic miRNA expression patterns across
      samples of the PA, carcinomatous portions (CA) of CXPA, as well as conventional
      PA. We selected 13 CXPA and 16 conventional PA FFPE samples, separated the PA and
      CA portions of CXPA samples and conducted miRNA profiling for each group. Among
      13 transcripts that were differentially expressed between PA and CA of CXPA,
      eight miRNAs were up-regulated and five down-regulated in CA. Bioinformatic
      analysis revealed that the up-regulated miRNAs were related to cancer progression
      and down-regulated ones to tumor suppression. Additionally, seven miRNAs were
      significantly up-regulated in PA of CXPA compared to conventional PA, although
      they are histopathologically similar. Almost all of these transcripts interacted 
      with TP53, a well-known tumor suppressor. In conclusion, we identified
      differentially expressed miRNAs in PA and CA of CXPA, which were closely
      associated with TP53 and various cancer-related pathways. We also identified
      differentially expressed miRNAs in the PA of CXPA and conventional PA which may
      serve as potential biomarkers.

AB  - Breast cancer is more common on the left side than the right side. We aim to
      evaluate differences in clinicopathological and genomic characteristics based on 
      laterality. We analyzed survival outcomes and clinical characteristics of 881,320
      patients recorded by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
      program. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to explore genomic and clinical 
      features from 1,062 patients. Gene expression data was used to quantitate
      cytolytic activity and hallmark gene-sets were used for gene set enrichment
      analysis. An institutional retrospective review was conducted on 155 patients
      treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). Patient characteristics were
      summarized by pathological complete response (pCR). Left sided tumors were found 
      to be more prevalent than right sided tumors. No major clinicopathological
      differences were noted by laterality. Left sided breast cancer demonstrated
      poorer outcomes versus right sided tumors (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.08; p = 0.011).
      Cell proliferation gene sets, including E2F Targets, G2M Checkpoint, Mitotic
      spindle, and MYC Targets, were enriched on the left side compared to the right.
      Left sided tumors had lower pCR rates versus right sided tumors (15.4% versus
      29.9%, p = 0.036). Our findings suggest that left sided breast cancer is
      associated with aggressive biology and worse outcomes compared to right sided
      breast cancer.

TI  - Improved overall survival is associated with adjuvant chemotherapy after
      definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for N3 nasopharyngeal cancer.
PG  - 13390
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16422-w [doi]
AB  - Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the established treatment for locally advanced
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, there is no evidence supporting routine 
      adjuvant chemotherapy. We aimed to demonstrate the effect of adjuvant
      chemotherapy on survival and distant metastasis in high-risk N3 NPC patients. We 
      linked the Taiwan Cancer Registry and Cause of Death database to obtain data.
      Clinical N3 NPC patients were divided as those receiving definitive concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with adjuvant 5-fluorouracil and platinum (PF)
      chemotherapy and those receiving no chemotherapy after CCRT. Patients receiving
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. We compared overall survival,
      disease-free survival, local control, and distant metastasis in both groups using
      Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Propensity-score matching was also 
      performed to evaluate the independent effect of adjuvant PF in a matched cohort
      with similar baseline characteristics. We included 431 patients (152 and 279
      patients in the adjuvant PF and observation groups, respectively). Median
      follow-up was 4.3 years. The 5-year overall survival were 69.1% and 57.4% in the 
      adjuvant PF chemotherapy and observation groups, respectively (p = 0.02).
      Adjuvant PF chemotherapy was associated with a lower risk of death (hazard ratio 
      [HR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.84; p = 0.003), even after
      adjusting for baseline prognostic factors (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.86; p = 0.005).
      Distant metastasis-free survival at 12 months was higher in the adjuvant PF
      chemotherapy group than in the observation group (98% vs 84.8%; p < 0.001). After
      adjusting for baseline prognostic factors, adjuvant PF chemotherapy was
      associated with freedom from distant metastasis (HR 0.11, 95% CI 0.02-0.46; p =
      0.003). Adjuvant chemotherapy was also associated with a decreased risk of death 
      (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.85, p = 0.004) in a propensity score-matched cohort.
      Prospective evaluation of adjuvant PF chemotherapy in N3 NPC patients treated
      with definitive CCRT is warranted because adjuvant PF chemotherapy was associated
      with improved overall survival and decreased risk of distant metastasis.

TI  - Long Non-coding RNA UCA1a Promotes Proliferation via PKM2 in Cervical Cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s43032-022-01042-6 [doi]
AB  - Cervical cancer is a common malignancy that affects women worldwide. The long
      non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial cancer-associated 1a (UCA1a) is reported to be
      significantly upregulated in cervical cancer. However, the exact role of UCA1a in
      cervical cancer remains unknown. This study aimed to identify two core promoter
      regions in UCA1a, which are essential for CEBPA-dependent transcription and
      FOXL1-, FOXL4-, and FOXL6-dependent activation, respectively. RNA sequencing
      results showed that overexpression of UCA1a resulted in extensive changes in the 
      gene expression profile of HeLa cells, especially in the signaling pathway that
      regulates tumorgenesis. Mass spectrometry assay was conducted to show that
      pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) was a UCA1a-interacting protein. The 400 ~ 800 nt long 
      region of UCA1a at the 5' end and the A1B domain of PKM2 were critical for the
      UCA1a-PKM2 interaction. Functional assays were performed to show that PKM2 was
      sufficient and necessary for UCA1a-induced proliferation of HeLa cells, which was
      partly due to the regulating of nuclear translocation and stabilization of PKM2. 
      These findings provide a novel mechanism for UCA1a to regulate Hela cells by
      ubiquitination degradation of PKM2 and suggest that UCA1a may play a key role in 
      the progression of cervical cancer.

TI  - Impact of adjuvants on the biophysical and functional characteristics of HIV
      vaccine-elicited antibodies in humans.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1038/s41541-022-00514-9 [doi]
AB  - Adjuvants can alter the magnitude, characteristics, and persistence of the
      humoral response to protein vaccination. HIV vaccination might benefit from
      tailored adjuvant choice as raising a durable and protective response to
      vaccination has been exceptionally challenging. Analysis of trials of partially
      effective HIV vaccines have identified features of the immune response that
      correlate with decreased risk, including high titers of V1V2-binding IgG and IgG3
      responses with low titers of V1V2-binding IgA responses and enhanced Fc effector 
      functions, notably antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
      antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). However, there has been limited 
      opportunity to compare the effect of different adjuvants on these activities in
      humans. Here, samples from the AVEG015 study, a phase 1 trial in which
      participants (n = 112) were immunized with gp120SF-2 and one of six different
      adjuvants or combinations thereof were assessed for antibody titer, biophysical
      features, and diverse effector functions. Three adjuvants, MF59 + MTP-PE, SAF/2, 
      and SAF/2 + MDP, increased the peak magnitude and durability of antigen-specific 
      IgG3, IgA, FcgammaR-binding responses and ADCP activity, as compared to alum.
      While multiple adjuvants increased the titer of IgG, IgG3, and IgA responses,
      none consistently altered the balance of IgG to IgA or IgG3 to IgA. Linear
      regression analysis identified biophysical features including gp120-specific IgG 
      and FcgammaR-binding responses that could predict functional activity, and
      network analysis identified coordinated aspects of the humoral response. These
      analyses reveal the ability of adjuvants to drive the character and function of
      the humoral response despite limitations of small sample size and immune
      variability in this human clinical trial.

AB  - Reptile sex determination is attracting much attention because the great
      diversity of sex-determination and dosage compensation mechanisms permits us to
      approach fundamental questions about mechanisms of sex chromosome turnover.
      Recent studies have made significant progress in better understanding diversity
      and conservation of reptile sex chromosomes, with however no reptile master sex
      determination genes identified. Here we describe an integrated genomics and
      cytogenetics pipeline, combining probes generated from the microdissected sex
      chromosomes with transcriptome and genome sequencing to explore the sex
      chromosome diversity in non-model Australian reptiles. We tested our pipeline on 
      a turtle, two species of geckos, and a monitor lizard. Genes identified on sex
      chromosomes were compared to the chicken genome to identify homologous regions
      among the four species. We identified candidate sex determining genes within
      these regions, including conserved vertebrate sex-determining genes pdgfa, pdgfra
      amh and wt1, and demonstrated their testis or ovary-specific expression. All four
      species showed gene-by-gene rather than chromosome-wide dosage compensation. Our 
      results imply that reptile sex chromosomes originated by independent acquisition 
      of sex-determining genes on different autosomes, as well as translocations
      between different ancestral macro- and microchromosomes. We discuss the
      evolutionary drivers of the slow differentiation and turnover of reptile sex
      chromosomes.

      receptor positive breast cancer.
PG  - 90
LID - 10.1038/s41523-022-00453-7 [doi]
AB  - The impact of adiposity on the efficacy of endocrine treatment in patients with
      estrogen receptor positive breast cancer is poorly investigated. Here, we
      retrospectively investigated in a cohort of 56 patients whether body mass index
      and/or mammary adiposity are associated with anti-proliferative response in the
      neoadjuvant setting. Anti-proliferative response was defined as high Ki67 at
      baseline (Ki67bl) and low Ki67 at surgery (Ki67srg), using the 14% cut-off.
      Mammary adipocyte size was assessed on hematoxylin and eosin slides from the
      surgical samples using digital pathology. A higher proportion of tumors with an
      anti-proliferative response was observed in patients with obesity (54.5%) as
      compared to patients with normal weight (9.0%) and patients with overweight
      (40.0%) (p = 0.031), confirmed by multivariable regression analysis adjusted for 
      baseline Ki67 (OR, obese vs normal weight: 13.76, 95%CI: 1.49-207.63, p = 0.020).
      Larger adipocyte diameter was identified as predictor of anti-proliferative
      response (OR per increase in diameter of 5 mum for adipocytes distant from the
      tumor: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.01-14.32, p = 0.046). This study suggests that
      anti-proliferative response to neoadjuvant letrozole might be more frequent in
      patients with increased systemic or mammary adiposity.

TI  - Impact of robotic surgery on patient flow and resource use intensity in ovarian
      cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s11701-022-01447-0 [doi]
AB  - There is an emerging focus on the role of robotic surgery in ovarian cancer. To
      date, the operational and cost implications of the procedure remain unknown. The 
      objective of the current study was to evaluate the impact of integrating
      minimally invasive robotic surgery on patient flow, resource utilization, and
      hospital costs associated with the treatment of ovarian cancer during the
      in-hospital and post-discharge processes. 261 patients operated for the primary
      treatment of ovarian cancer between January 2006 and November 2014 at a
      university-affiliated tertiary hospital were included in this study. Outcomes
      were compared by surgical approach (robotic vs. open surgery) as well as pre- and
      post-implementation of the robotics platform for use in ovarian cancer. The
      in-hospital patient flow and number of emergency room visits within 3 months of
      surgery were evaluated using multi-state Markov models and generalized linear
      regression models, respectively. Robotic surgery cases were associated with lower
      rates of postoperative complications, resulted in a more expedited postoperative 
      patient flow (e.g., shorter time in the recovery room, ICU, and inpatient ward), 
      and were between $10,376 and $7,421 less expensive than the average laparotomy,
      depending on whether or not depreciation and amortization of the robotic platform
      were included. After discharge, patients who underwent robotic surgery were less 
      likely to return to the ER (IRR 0.42, p = 0.02, and IRR 0.47, p = 0.055, in the
      univariate and multivariable models, respectively). With appropriate use of the
      technology, the addition of robotics to the medical armamentarium for the
      management of ovarian cancer, when clinically feasible, can bring about
      operational efficiencies and entails cost savings.

TI  - Outcomes After Major Surgical Procedures in Octogenarians: A Nationwide Cohort
      Study.
LID - 10.1007/s00268-022-06642-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Aging of the worldwide population has been observed, and
      postoperative outcomes could be worse in elderly patients. This nationwide study 
      assessed trends in number of surgical resections in octogenarians regarding
      various major surgical procedures and associated postoperative outcomes. METHODS:
      All patients who underwent surgery between 2014 and 2018 were included from Dutch
      nationwide quality registries regarding esophageal, stomach, pancreas, colorectal
      liver metastases, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and abdominal aortic aneurysms
      (AAA). For each quality registry, the number of patients who were 80 years or
      older (octogenarians) was calculated per year. Postoperative outcomes were length
      of stay (LOS), 30 day major morbidity and 30 day mortality between octogenarians 
      and younger patients. RESULTS: No increase in absolute number and proportion of
      octogenarians that underwent surgery was observed. Median LOS was higher in
      octogenarians who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer, colorectal liver
      metastases, lung cancer, pancreatic disease and esophageal cancer. 30 day major
      morbidity was higher in octogenarians who underwent surgery for colon cancer,
      esophageal cancer and elective AAA-repair. 30 day mortality was higher in
      octogenarians who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer, lung cancer, stomach
      cancer, pancreatic disease, esophageal cancer and elective AAA-repair. Median LOS
      decreased between 2014 and 2018 in octogenarians who underwent surgery for
      stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. 30 day major morbidity decreased between
      2014 and 2018 in octogenarians who underwent surgery for colon cancer. No trends 
      were observed in octogenarians regarding 30 day mortality between 2014 and 2018. 
      CONCLUSION: No increase over time in absolute number and proportion of
      octogenarians that underwent major surgery was observed in the Netherlands.
      Postoperative outcomes were worse in octogenarians.

TI  - White adipose tissue-derived factors and prostate cancer progression: mechanisms 
      and targets for interventions.
LID - 10.1007/s10555-022-10056-0 [doi]
AB  - Obesity represents an important risk factor for prostate cancer, driving more
      aggressive disease, chemoresistance, and increased mortality. White adipose
      tissue (WAT) overgrowth in obesity is central to the mechanisms that lead to
      these clinical observations. Adipose stromal cells (ASCs), the progenitors to
      mature adipocytes and other cell types in WAT, play a vital role in driving PCa
      aggressiveness. ASCs produce numerous factors, especially chemokines, including
      the chemokine CXCL12, which is involved in driving EMT and chemoresistance in
      PCa. A greater understanding of the impact of WAT in obesity-induced progression 
      of PCa and the underlying mechanisms has begun to provide opportunities for
      developing interventional strategies for preventing or offsetting these critical 
      events. These include weight loss regimens, therapeutic targeting of ASCs, use of
      calorie restriction mimetic compounds, and combinations of compounds as well as
      specific receptor targeting strategies.

TI  - Signet-ring cell carcinoma of the appendix with ganglioneuromatosis: a case
      report.
PG  - 151
LID - 10.1186/s40792-022-01509-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary cancer of the appendix, especially signet-ring cell
      carcinoma, is an uncommon disease, and it is rarely suspected before surgery.
      Diffuse intestinal ganglioneuromatosis that is not associated with
      neurofibromatosis-1 or multiple endocrine neoplasia 2b is also rare. The most
      frequent symptoms caused by it are changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, and
      occlusive episodes. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 48-year-old woman who
      had a month-long history of chronic abdominal pain, fullness, constipation, and
      diarrhoea. Enhanced computed tomography showed a 100-mm irregular swelling in the
      appendix and thickening of the appendiceal wall with cystic dilatation. Based on 
      a preoperative diagnosis of appendiceal cancer, the patient underwent
      laparoscopic ileocecal resection with D3 lymph node dissection. Pathological
      diagnosis revealed a signet-ring cell carcinoma of the appendix with
      ganglioneuromatosis. The patient completed four courses of capecitabine plus
      oxaliplatin (CAPEOX) as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and 23-month
      postoperative outcome was noneventful without recurrence. CONCLUSION: We report a
      signet-ring cell carcinoma of the appendix that was detected early because of its
      presence with ganglioneuromatosis.

TI  - Inflammatory prognostic factors in advanced or recurrent esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma treated with nivolumab.
LID - 10.1007/s00262-022-03265-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Japan, nivolumab administration is the standard treatment for
      patients with unresectable advanced or recurrent esophageal squamous cell
      carcinoma (ESCC) who are refractory or intolerant to fluoropyrimidines and
      platinum-based chemotherapy. We determined if inflammatory prognostic factors are
      useful in patients with ESCC treated with nivolumab monotherapy. METHODS: The
      clinical data of patients with ESCC treated with nivolumab monotherapy as the
      second- or later-line treatment were retrospectively analyzed.
      Neutrophil/lymphocyte, platelet/lymphocyte, and C-reactive protein/albumin ratios
      (CAR); prognostic index; and prognostic nutritional index were investigated.
      Cut-off values for each factor were determined according to overall survival
      using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: During
      January 2017-June 2021, 93 consecutive patients with ESCC were enrolled from five
      institutions (median age, 70 years; male, 77%). With a median follow-up period of
      9.1 (range, 1.0-34.7) months, the median overall and progression-free survival
      were 12.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.0-16.6) and 4.0 (95% CI, 2.6-5.4)
      months, respectively. Of five inflammatory prognostic factors, the cut-off value 
      for CAR was 0.62; prognosis was significantly longer in those with CAR < 0.62
      (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.67; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory
      prognostic factors were useful in predicting prognosis for ESCC patients
      pretreated with nivolumab, especially for those with CAR < 0.62, suggesting that 
      CAR adequately reflects prognosis.

TI  - Robotic pancreatoduodenectomy: trends in technique and training challenges.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-022-09469-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: More complex cases are being performed robotically. This study aims
      to characterize trends in robotic pancreatoduodenectomy (RPD) over time and
      assess opportunities for advanced trainees. METHODS: Using the ACS-NSQIP database
      from 2014 to 2019, PD cases were characterized by operative approach (open-OPN,
      laparoscopic-LAP, robotic-ROB). Proficiency and postoperative outcomes were
      described by approach over time. RESULTS: 24,268 PDs were identified, with the
      ROB approach increasing from 2.8% to 7.5%. Unplanned conversion increased over
      time for LAP (27.7-39.0%, p = 0.003) but was unchanged for ROB cases (14.8-14.7%,
      p = 0.257). Morbidity increased for OPN PD (35.5-36.8%, p = 0.041) and decreased 
      for ROB PD (38.7-30.3%, p = 0.010). Mean LOS was lower in ROB than LAP/OPN (9.5
      vs. 10.9 vs. 10.9 days, p < 0.00001). Approximately, 100 AHPBA, SSO, and ASTS
      fellows are being trained each year in North America; however, only about 5 RPDs 
      are available per trainee per year which is far below that recommended to achieve
      proficiency. CONCLUSION: Over a 6-year period, a significant increase was
      observed in the use of RPD without a concomitant increase in conversion rates.
      RPD was associated with decreased morbidity and length of stay. Despite this
      shift, the number of cases being performed is not adequate for all fellows to
      achieve proficiency before graduation.

      hookah users are exposed to not only carcinogenic compounds but also
      microorganisms that may play an active role in the development of both infectious
      and chronic diseases among users. Nevertheless, existing hookah research in this 
      area has focused only on microorganisms that may be transferred to users through 
      the smoking apparatus and not on bacterial communities associated with hookah
      tobacco. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted time-series experiments on
      commercially available hookah brands (Al Fakher (flavors: two apple, mint, and
      watermelon) and Fumari (flavors: white gummy bear, ambrosia, and mint chocolate
      chill)) stored under three different temperature and relative humidity conditions
      over 14 days. To characterize bacterial communities, the total DNA was extracted 
      on days 0, 5, 9, and 14, PCR-amplified for the V3V4 region of the bacterial 16S
      rRNA gene, sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform, and analyzed using R.
      Diversity (alpha and beta) analyses revealed that the microbiotas of Fumari and
      Al Fakher products differed significantly and that flavor had a significant
      effect on the hookah microbiota. Overall, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Sphingomonas,
      and Methylobacterium were the predominant bacterial taxa across all products.
      Additionally, we observed compositional differences between hookah brands across 
      the 14-day incubation. These data suggest that the bacterial communities of
      hookah tobacco are diverse and differ across brands and flavors, which may have
      critical implications regarding exposures to specific bacteria among hookah
      users. KEY POINTS: * Commercial hookah products harbor diverse bacterial
      communities. * Brands and flavors impact the diversity of these communities. *
      Research on their viability and transmission to users' respiratory tracts is
      needed.

TI  - Anti-COX-2 autoantibody is a novel biomarker of immune aplastic anemia.
LID - 10.1038/s41375-022-01654-6 [doi]
AB  - In immune aplastic anemia (IAA), severe pancytopenia results from the
      immune-mediated destruction of hematopoietic stem cells. Several autoantibodies
      have been reported, but no clinically applicable autoantibody tests are available
      for IAA. We screened autoantibodies using a microarray containing >9000 proteins 
      and validated the findings in a large international cohort of IAA patients (n =
      405) and controls (n = 815). We identified a novel autoantibody that binds to the
      C-terminal end of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2, aCOX-2 Ab). In total, 37% of all adult
      IAA patients tested positive for aCOX-2 Ab, while only 1.7% of the controls were 
      aCOX-2 Ab positive. Sporadic non-IAA aCOX-2 Ab positive cases were observed among
      patients with related bone marrow failure diseases, multiple sclerosis, and type 
      I diabetes, whereas no aCOX-2 Ab seropositivity was detected in the healthy
      controls, in patients with non-autoinflammatory diseases or rheumatoid arthritis.
      In IAA, anti-COX-2 Ab positivity correlated with age and the HLA-DRB1*15:01
      genotype. 83% of the >40 years old IAA patients with HLA-DRB1*15:01 were
      anti-COX-2 Ab positive, indicating an excellent sensitivity in this group. aCOX-2
      Ab positive IAA patients also presented lower platelet counts. Our results
      suggest that aCOX-2 Ab defines a distinct subgroup of IAA and may serve as a
      valuable disease biomarker.

TI  - Improving MGMT methylation status prediction of glioblastoma through optimizing
      radiomics features using genetic algorithm-based machine learning approach.
PG  - 13412
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17707-w [doi]
AB  - O6-Methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation was shown in
      many studies to be an important predictive biomarker for temozolomide (TMZ)
      resistance and poor progression-free survival in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
      patients. However, identifying the MGMT methylation status using molecular
      techniques remains challenging due to technical limitations, such as the
      inability to obtain tumor specimens, high prices for detection, and the high
      complexity of intralesional heterogeneity. To overcome these difficulties, we
      aimed to test the feasibility of using a novel radiomics-based machine learning
      (ML) model to preoperatively and noninvasively predict the MGMT methylation
      status. In this study, radiomics features extracted from multimodal images of GBM
      patients with annotated MGMT methylation status were downloaded from The Cancer
      Imaging Archive (TCIA) public database for retrospective analysis. The radiomics 
      features extracted from multimodal images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      had undergone a two-stage feature selection method, including an eXtreme Gradient
      Boosting (XGBoost) feature selection model followed by a genetic algorithm
      (GA)-based wrapper model for extracting the most meaningful radiomics features
      for predictive purposes. The cross-validation results suggested that the GA-based
      wrapper model achieved the high performance with a sensitivity of 0.894,
      specificity of 0.966, and accuracy of 0.925 for predicting the MGMT methylation
      status in GBM. Application of the extracted GBM radiomics features on a low-grade
      glioma (LGG) dataset also achieved a sensitivity 0.780, specificity 0.620, and
      accuracy 0.750, indicating the potential of the selected radiomics features to be
      applied more widely on both low- and high-grade gliomas. The performance
      indicated that our model may potentially confer significant improvements in
      prognosis and treatment responses in GBM patients.
